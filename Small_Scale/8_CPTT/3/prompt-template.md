You are playing the Corsi board tapping game. You will be shown a video with 5 boxes (blue squares). These boxes will be tapped one at a time in a specific sequence. A tap on a box will be shown by highlighting the box in yellow. You must remember the sequence of taps by remembering which exact boxes were tapped. Here is the video.
<IMAGE 0>,
<IMAGE 1>,
<IMAGE 2>,
<IMAGE 3>,
<IMAGE 4>,

You must now identify the sequence of taps and choose correct index sequences from the following choices (index from top-left to bottom-right, zero-indexed, and row first).

Here are your choices: 
(1) (0, 0), (1, 0), (3, 3), (2, 2), (1, 2)
(2) (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), (1, 2)
(3) (3, 0), (0, 1), (3, 1), (2, 2), (1, 3)
(4) (1, 1), (1, 0), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2)

Think step by step. Then answer your question in the following json format.

```
{
    "answer": <fill in one of 1/2/3/4 integer value>
}
```
