You are playing the Corsi board tapping game. You will be shown a video with 5 boxes (blue squares). These boxes will be tapped one at a time in a specific sequence. A tap on a box will be shown by highlighting the box in yellow. You must remember the sequence of taps by remembering which exact boxes were tapped. Here is the video sequence.
