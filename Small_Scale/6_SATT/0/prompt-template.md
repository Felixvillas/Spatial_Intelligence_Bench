Here is an image of a tree. Let us call this the target.
<IMAGE OF TARGET>

Here is a grid of tree images. This contains multiple instances of tree, but not all of them are the target object. The grid is indexed from top-left to bottom-right, starting from row, column = (0, 0).
<IMAGE OF GRID>

Which of these options represent the true locations of the target object in the grid? Locations are represented as (row, column).
Choice 1. (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)
Choice 2. (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 0), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4)
Choice 3. (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4)
Choice 4. (0, 5), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (5, 5)

Think step by step. Then answer your question in the following json format. 

```
{
    "answer": <fill in one of 1/2/3/4 integer value>
}
```
