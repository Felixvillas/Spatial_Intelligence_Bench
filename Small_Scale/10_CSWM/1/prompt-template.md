**USER:** You are playing the Cambridge Spatial Working Memory game. You will be shown a screen with blue boxes. A treasure is hidden in one of the blue boxes. You must identify the box containing the treasure, which is shown as an yellow square. Once you find a treasure, it will be collected and placed in the "Treasures collected" section shown below the image. A new treasure will be hidden in one of the other boxes where the treasure did not appear before. You must again find the new treasure. This process is repeated till you find all treasures placed in each of the blue boxes once. Note: The treasure will never appear in a box where it had already been placed.

Each turn, there are randomly selected numbers associated with each box. These numbers are meant to aid you with communication, i.e., specify what box you want to open in that turn. However, these numbers will change after every turn. So do NOT associate boxes with numbers over the long term. The number identity of a box can change any time. Therefore, you must remember the boxes based on their spatial positions and not the numbers.

RESPONSE FORMAT: 
Think step-by-step about where the treasure might be based on your past actions. After that, indicate the box you want to open in the following json format:

```
{
    "action": <box integer index>
}
```

**USER:** Here is the current state of the game. You must find the next treasure. Note that the numbers of the boxes have changed, but the box locations are fixed. Decide which box you want to open next, and then use the number associated with the box as the action.
