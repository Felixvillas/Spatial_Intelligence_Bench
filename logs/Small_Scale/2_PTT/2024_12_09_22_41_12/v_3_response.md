To solve the problem, follow these steps:

1. **Identify your position**: You are standing at the cake.
2. **Identify your initial direction**: You are facing the desk.
3. **Locate the objects in the image**:
   - Cake is on the left side.
   - Desk is slightly to the right and down.
   - Bat is to the right of the cake and above the desk.

4. **Determine the direction to the bat**: 
   - From the cake to the bat, visualize the angle.
   - The bat is slightly right of directly above, starting from the straight line to the desk.
   
5. **Estimate the angle**:
   - Since the desk is straight ahead, the line to the bat is slightly clockwise from vertical.

Given the options:
1) -19
2) 21
3) 1
4) -39

The angle to the bat relative to the desk is best approximated as slightly clockwise, so around 21 degrees.
