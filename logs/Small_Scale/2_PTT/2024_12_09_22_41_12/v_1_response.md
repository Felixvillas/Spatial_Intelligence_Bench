To determine the angle, let's break down the scenario:

1. **Your Position**: You¡¯re standing at the bat.
2. **Facing**: Your initial orientation is towards the book.
3. **Objective**: Find the angle from your current facing direction (towards the book) to the apple.

### Step-by-step Analysis

- **Visualize a coordinate system**: 
  - The bat (your position) is the origin.
  - You are facing the book, which is to your right on the plane. This initial direction can be considered 0 degrees.

- **Relative Positions**:
  - **Apple**: It is located slightly below your current line of sight (towards the book) and to the left.
  
- **Angle Calculation**:
  - To turn from facing the book to facing the apple, you would rotate counter-clockwise.

- **Estimate the Angle**:
  - Since the apple is slightly below and to the left, the rotation is less than -90 degrees (which would point directly left).
  - A rough estimate considering the position should be around -35 degrees.

Based on this analysis, the nearest angle option is -35 degrees.
