To find the angle at which the apple is located relative to your position at the chair facing the dog:

1. **Determine the Direction**: Standing at the chair and facing the dog implies you are facing left in the image.
2. **Visualize Directions**:
   - **Facing Left (Dog)**: 0 degrees
   - **Directly Behind (Right)**: 180 degrees
   - **Directly in Front (Left)**: 0 degrees
   - **Below (Downwards)**: -90 degrees
   - **Above (Upwards)**: 90 degrees
3. **Location of Apple**: The apple is below and a bit to the left.
4. **Determine Angle**: Since the apple is below you as you face left, the angle is slightly more negative than -90 degrees. This makes -120 degrees plausible from the given options.

Based on this visualization, the apple is approximately at -120 degrees relative to the starting position facing the dog.
