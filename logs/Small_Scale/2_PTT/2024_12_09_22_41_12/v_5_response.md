To solve the problem, let's visualize the position of the objects:

- The fish is where we are standing, facing the bat.
- The bat is directly in front of us.
- The grape is located to the left side of the fish.

When facing the bat, the grape is at an angle to our left, which means it's an anti-clockwise rotation. Therefore, the angle is negative.

Now, let's determine the possible angle:
- The grape is around the same level horizontally as the fish but to the left, so approximately -90 degrees anti-clockwise.

Checking the options:
1. 47
2. 7
3. -47
4. 90

The closest angle for the grape's position is -47 degrees.

Based on this assessment:
