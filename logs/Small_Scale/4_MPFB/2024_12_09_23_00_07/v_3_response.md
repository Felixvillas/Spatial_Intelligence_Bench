To determine which choice correctly fits the puzzle pieces together, we can analyze the shapes and how they align. Let's examine step by step:

1. **Identify the shapes:** We have one triangle and four quadrilaterals.
2. **Analyze each choice:**
   - **Choice 1:** The pieces do not fit together without overlapping or gaps.
   - **Choice 2:** The arrangement has overlapping pieces.
   - **Choice 3:** Pieces fit together correctly without any overlap or gaps.
   - **Choice 4:** There is a gap in the arrangement, so the pieces do not fit correctly.

Based on this analysis, **Choice 3** shows the correct placement of the pieces.
