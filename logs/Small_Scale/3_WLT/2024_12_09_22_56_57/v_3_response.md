To determine the new water level when the container is rotated:

1. The container is initially a square, partially filled with water.
2. When rotated to a diamond shape, the water will adjust to maintain a horizontal surface.
3. The area of the water when the container was upright is 25% of the square, which is \(h = \frac{1}{4}\) in height.
4. In the diamond shape, the water will occupy a triangular or trapezoidal area, but must still make up 25% of the area of the rotated square.
5. Visually and mathematically, this corresponds to having the water level approximately halfway across the bottom edge of the diamond.

Therefore, the correct choice is Choice 3. Here is the answer in the required format:
