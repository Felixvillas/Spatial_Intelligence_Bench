To decide the water level in the rotated container, we must remember that the volume of water remains constant regardless of orientation. Therefore, the water will settle in the lowest part of the container given its rotated position. 

Looking at the options:
- The original container has water filling about one-fourth of its height.
- When the container is tilted, the water will spread out, maintaining a horizontal surface until it reaches the sides of the container.

Let's analyze the choices:
- **Choice 1**: The water level here is higher on one side and lower on the other side, which is consistent with how water would settle.
- **Choice 2**: The water is level but does not reach enough of the container sides compared to the expected spread in a tilted position.
- **Choice 3**: Similar to choice 2, it is level but not adjusted correctly for a tilted position.
- **Choice 4**: The water reaches higher up the sides as it would when tilted since it spreads evenly across the base towards the higher wall.

The correct choice should show the water following the natural horizontal line in the tilted container, which is represented in **Choice 1**.
