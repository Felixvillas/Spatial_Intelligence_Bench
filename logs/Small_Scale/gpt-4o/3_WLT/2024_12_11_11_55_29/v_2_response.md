To determine the new water level when the container is tilted, consider these steps:

1. **Initial Water Volume:** The amount of water remains the same.
2. **Shape Change:** Tilting changes the shape of how water occupies the container but not the volume.
3. **Surface Level:** Water seeks the lowest point due to gravity, creating a horizontal surface.

**Tilted Container Analysis:**

- **Choice 1:** The water level appears too low and slanted, not matching the volume from the original position.
- **Choice 2:** The water level is too high; it doesn't account for the same amount of water.
- **Choice 3:** Appears to match original water volume and level upon tilting, maintaining horizontal surface.
- **Choice 4:** The water level is too high and covers too much area.

The correct choice based on volume conservation and horizontal surface when tilted is:
