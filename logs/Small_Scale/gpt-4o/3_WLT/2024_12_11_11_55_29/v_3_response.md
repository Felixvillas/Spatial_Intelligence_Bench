To determine the water level when the container is rotated, consider the original water level in the upright container, which is partway up the side. When the square is tilted, the water line will remain horizontal due to gravity. Let's evaluate each choice:

1. Choice 1: The water level is diagonal, which is incorrect as the water line should be horizontal.
2. Choice 2: The water level appears too high and extends beyond the center.
3. Choice 3: The water is centered in the base, which seems unlikely given the original water level covers nearly half the height when upright.
4. Choice 4: The water level appears symmetric and is a horizontal line across the middle, which is most likely correct because it maintains the original volume distribution.

Based on this reasoning, the correct choice is:
