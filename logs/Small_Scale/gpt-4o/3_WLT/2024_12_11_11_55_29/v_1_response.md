To solve this, consider the following:

1. **Initial Level**: The water initially fills half of the spherical part of the container.

2. **Understanding the Rotation**: When the container is rotated such that the neck is angled up and to the right, the volume of water remains unchanged but redistributes due to gravity.

3. **Finding the New Water Level**: The water will spread across the lower half of the sphere, maintaining the same overall volume. This will create a diagonal line if viewed from the side.

Given this reasoning, the water level will look like choice 4, where the diagonal line indicates an even distribution within the sphere given the volume of water.
