To determine the correct water level when the container is rotated, consider these steps:

1. **Understand the Original Water Level**: In the unrotated container, the water fills the bottom half of a rectangle.

2. **Effect of Rotation**: When the container is rotated, the volume of water remains constant, meaning that the surface of the water should remain horizontal. The shape the water forms will be a trapezoid.

3. **Analyze the Options**:
   - **Choice 1**: Water level is too high to match half the original container's height.
   - **Choice 2**: Water level forms a trapezoid with a horizontal surface, keeping the same volume.
   - **Choice 3**: Water level is too low.
   - **Choice 4**: Water level seems to have a slanted surface, which is incorrect as the water surface should be horizontal.

Therefore, the correct choice, where the surface remains horizontal and the volume is preserved, is **Choice 2**.
