To determine the new water level after rotation:

1. Start by recognizing that the water maintains the same volume.
2. Understand that gravity will make the water settle at the bottom of the container.
3. The surface of the water will be parallel to the bottom edge of the rotated container.

Analyzing the choices:
- **Choice 1** has the water parallel to the desired orientation. 
- Check if choices depict this parallel nature with the initial volume consideration.

Conclusion:
- **Choice 1** shows the water level that maintains the same volume and aligns correctly with the container's new orientation.
