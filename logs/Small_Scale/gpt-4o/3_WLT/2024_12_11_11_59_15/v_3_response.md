To determine the water level when the container is tilted, consider the following:

1. The first container shows that it's filled halfway with water, indicating the filled volume is half of the total volume.
2. When the container is tilted, the volume of water remains constant.
3. The water level will adjust to maintain the same volume while obeying gravity.

With these steps in mind, Choice 4 matches the expected water level when the container is rotated, keeping half of the container's area filled with water.
