To determine the water level when the container is rotated, we need to think about how the water settles in the new orientation. 

Initially, the water fills half the spherical part of the container. When rotated, the volume of water remains the same, and it will settle at the lowest possible point due to gravity.

Here's the analysis step-by-step:

1. The container is half-filled in its original upright position (as shown in the first image).
2. Rotating the container by 90 degrees will not change the volume of water, but the water will adjust to fill the lowest part of the container.

Given these considerations, the water level in the rotated container corresponds to choice 4, as it represents the water adjusting to the lowest position while maintaining the same volume.
