To determine the water level in the rotated container, we need to consider the following:

1. **Initial Water Level**: 
   - The initial container is filled up to a certain height with water.

2. **Properties of Liquid**: 
   - Water will always settle at the lowest point and maintain a horizontal surface due to gravity.

3. **Rotation Effect**:
   - When the container is rotated, the water will shift to maintain a flat, horizontal surface.
   - The volume of water doesn't change, so the shifted water level in the new orientation will have the same volume.

4. **Visual Inspection**:
   - Look for the container in the choices where the water stays flat horizontally and maintains the same volume proportionally.

By examining the options, we see that:

- **Choice 1**: Water slants from top left to bottom right. Not horizontal, at an angle.
- **Choice 2**: Water has a horizontal top line, maintaining the correct volume.
- **Choice 3**: Water is also horizontal, but positioned lower, not matching initial volume.
- **Choice 4**: Water is too high and takes up too much volume.

Therefore, the correct choice is where the water remains horizontally flat along the top and takes up the correct volume, which matches **Choice 2**.
