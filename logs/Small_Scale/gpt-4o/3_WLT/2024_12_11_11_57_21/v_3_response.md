To determine the water level in the rotated container, consider the volume of water and how it would settle in the new orientation.

1. Initially, the container is half filled with water.
2. When rotated to its corner, the water will still occupy the same volume.
3. The water will form a horizontal line of equal height relative to the base that it touches.

The correct representation of the water level in the rotated container corresponds to Choice 4.
