To determine the water level when the container is rotated, we need to consider the volume of water, which remains constant. 

Given the original container:
- The water fills half of the spherical part.

When rotated, the volume must still occupy half of the sphere. Thus, the water level will be a diagonal line across the rotated circle to maintain the same volume proportion.

Examining the choices:
1. Shows less than half of the sphere filled.
2. Shows a diagonal line dividing the sphere into two equal areas.
3. Shows a horizontal line across the middle (not fitting the tilted scenario).
4. Shows a diagonal from top to bottom but in the wrong direction.

Choice 2 correctly shows the diagonal line in the tilted position.
