To determine the water level when the container is rotated:

1. **Original State**: The container is partially filled with water. The water level will remain constant as it rotates because water seeks its level due to gravity, which means the volume of water initially present determines the surface line.

2. **Rotated State Analysis**: 
   - When you rotate the container, the water will adjust to form a horizontal line across the container, maintaining the same volume.

3. **Matching to Choices**:
   - **Choice 1**: Water surface is at an angle. This does not match as the water surface in reality seeks a horizontal line.
   - **Choice 2**: This shows a horizontal water level. However, the amount of water does not seem consistent with the original amount.
   - **Choice 3**: The water level is at an angle. Incorrect as explained.
   - **Choice 4**: The water level is horizontal and appears consistent with the volume from the original upright container. 

Therefore, Choice 4 is consistent with how water would behave when the container is rotated.
