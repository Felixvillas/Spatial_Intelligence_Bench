To determine the water level in the rotated container, we need to consider the principle that water always seeks to remain level.

1. **Original Container**: The container is filled halfway with water.
2. **Rotated Container**: When rotated, the water will adjust to maintain a horizontal level relative to gravity.

Looking at the choices:

- **Choice 1**: The water appears to be higher on one side and does not level properly.
- **Choice 2**: The water is leveled horizontally and appears to correspond correctly to the halfway volume.
- **Choice 3**: The water is too high on one side; it doesn't maintain a flat horizontal level.
- **Choice 4**: Similarly, the water does not appear level and is skewed to one side.

The correct choice is **Choice 2**, as it shows the water maintaining a horizontal level that matches how it should adjust when the container is tilted.
