To determine the water level when the container is rotated:

1. Volume of water remains constant.
2. In the original position, the water level is halfway up the container's height.
3. When rotated, the water will maintain a horizontal surface due to gravity.

By visualizing these steps, Choice 3 shows the water level correctly when the container is tilted, where the surface is flat but at an angle compared to the container's sides.
