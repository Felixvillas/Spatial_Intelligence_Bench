To determine the water level when the container is rotated:

1. **Initial Condition**: The container originally is half-filled with water. With the flask upright, the water divides the circle into two equal parts.

2. **Rotation Impact**: When the flask is rotated, the volume of water inside remains constant.

3. **Effect of Tilt**: As the flask tilts, the water level will adjust to maintain the same volume. The water will create a diagonal line as the water redistributes evenly within the new shape of the container.

4. **Choice Analysis**:
   - **Choice 1** and **Choice 3** have horizontal water lines, which aren't possible given the tilt.
   - **Choice 2** shows a diagonal water level, perfectly aligned with maintaining the same volume as the original position when tilted.
   - **Choice 4** shows a diagonal, but the angle or volume is not correctly maintained.

Hence, the expected water level in the rotated container is shown in **Choice 2**.
