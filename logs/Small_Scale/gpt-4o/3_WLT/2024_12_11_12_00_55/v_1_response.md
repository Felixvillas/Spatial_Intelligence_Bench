To determine the correct water level when the container is rotated:

1. The original water level is halfway up the spherical part of the flask.
2. When rotating the flask, this volume of water must remain the same.
3. The shape of the liquid will adjust, maintaining the same volume.

Given these points, the liquid will form a diagonal line across the sphere, ensuring equal distribution due to gravity. Therefore, the expected water level when rotated matches **Choice 4**.
