To determine the water level in the rotated container, consider that the water will find its level based on gravity, maintaining a horizontal surface.

1. The original container is half-filled, so the volume of water should remain consistent.
2. When rotated, the water will adjust to keep the surface level horizontal.
3. Comparing the choices, **Choice 2** shows a water level that matches the expected horizontal plane and covers approximately half the area of the container.

Thus, the answer is:
