To determine the water level in the rotated container, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Water Level**: The container initially has a horizontal water level.
2. **Rotation**: When the container is rotated, the water level stays horizontal due to gravity.
3. **New Orientation**: In the rotated container, the water will still maintain a horizontal level relative to the ground.

Comparing the choices:

- **Choice 1**: Water level is slanted downward from left to right. (Incorrect)
- **Choice 2**: Water is horizontal in the rotated orientation. (Correct)
- **Choice 3**: Water is slanted downward from right to left. (Incorrect)
- **Choice 4**: Water is horizontal, but higher than the starting level. (Incorrect)

Therefore, the correct choice, where the water level is horizontal in the rotated container, is Choice 2.
