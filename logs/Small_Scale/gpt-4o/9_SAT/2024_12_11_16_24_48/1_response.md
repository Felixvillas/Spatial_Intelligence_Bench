To solve the array addition:

First, let's map the arrays:

First Array:
```
[1, 1, 0, 0]
[0, 1, 0, 0]
[2, 0, 0, 1]
```

Second Array:
```
[1, 1, 0, 2]
[0, 1, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 1]
```

Now, perform the addition according to the rules:

Sum:
- Row 1: [white, white, empty, white]
- Row 2: [empty, white, empty, empty]
- Row 3: [blue, empty, empty, white]

So the final summed array is:

- First row: white, white, empty, white
- Second row: empty, white, empty, empty
- Third row: blue, empty, empty, blue

This matches **Choice 3**:

```
[ ⬜️ ⬦ ⬦ ⬜️ ]
[     ⬜️      ]
[ ⬦           ⬜️ ]
```
