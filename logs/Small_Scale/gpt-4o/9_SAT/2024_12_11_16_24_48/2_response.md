To solve the array addition:

1. **Identify values in the arrays**:
   - **Blue circle** = 1
   - **White circle** = 2
   - **Red circle** = ignore

2. **Combine the arrays**: 
   - Add values cell by cell according to the rules provided.

3. **Rules for addition**:
   - 0 + 0 = 0 (empty cell)
   - 1 + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1 (blue circle)
   - 1 + 1 = 2 (white circle)

**Step-by-step Addition**:

1. **First row**:
   - 1 (blue) + 1 (blue) = 2 (white)
   - 0 + 0 = 0
   - 1 (blue) + 1 (blue) = 2 (white)

2. **Second row**:
   - 1 (blue) + 0 = 1 (blue)
   - 0 + 1 (blue) = 1 (blue)
   - 0 + 0 = 0

3. **Third row**:
   - 0 + 0 = 0
   - 0 + 0 = 0
   - 1 (blue) + 0 = 1 (blue)

4. **Fourth row**:
   - 0 + 0 = 0
   - 1 (blue) + 0 = 1 (blue)
   - 1 (blue) + 0 = 1 (blue)

5. **Fifth row**:
   - 0 + 0 = 0
   - 1 (blue) + 0 = 1 (blue)
   - 0 + 0 = 0

The resulting summed array follows the pattern described. Thus, the correct choice is **Choice 4**.
