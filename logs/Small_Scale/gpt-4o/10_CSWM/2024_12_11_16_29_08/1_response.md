Let's analyze the previous actions step-by-step:

1. Opened box at the bottom-left position (twice) - found a treasure on the first attempt.
2. Opened box at the middle-right position - found a treasure.
3. Opened box at the top-left position - found a treasure.
4. Opened box at the bottom-right position - found a treasure.

The only box left unopened is the one at the top-right position.
