To find the next treasure, we need to remember which boxes have already contained treasures:

1. The middle-left box (first treasure).
2. The top-right box (second treasure).
3. The bottom-left box (third treasure).

The remaining boxes where the treasure might be are:

- Top-left
- Middle-right
- Bottom-right

Let's choose one of these remaining boxes. I will select the top-left box.
