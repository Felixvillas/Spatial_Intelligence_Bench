To determine the angle between the two lines in the first image:

1. **Identify Line Directions**: The lines in the image seem to be positioned closer to a right angle when compared to the reference lines.
   
2. **Reference Lines Comparison**: 
   - Using the reference legend, the pair of lines that approximates a right angle the most would typically be closer to lines 1 and 6.
   - Other options, such as Lines 1 and 3 or Lines 1 and 9, indicate a smaller angle than a right angle.
   - Lines 1 and 7 suggest a slightly acute angle but not as close as Lines 1 and 6 for a right angle.

3. **Conclusion**: Based on visual estimation, the original lines in the image match best with the reference lines 1 and 6.
