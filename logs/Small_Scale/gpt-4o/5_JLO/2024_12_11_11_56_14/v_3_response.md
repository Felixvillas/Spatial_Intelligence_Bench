To determine which reference line pair matches the angle between the original lines, we can follow these steps:

1. **Estimate the Angle in the Original Image**: Look at the provided image of the two lines. The lines appear to form an acute angle, which is less than 90 degrees.

2. **Analyze the Reference Angles**: Using the legend with reference lines numbered 1 to 11:  
   - Line 1 is the horizontal baseline.  
   - Each set of lines from 1 to the others (e.g., 3, 7, 9, etc.) increases in angle.  

3. **Match the Angle Visually**:
   - Compare the original angle with the angles made by the numbered reference pairs.

4. **Select the Most Similar Angle**: Considering the original lines are quite wide apart but still less than the steepest line (likely Line 6), visually the angle looks closer to:
   - Lines 1 and 9 from the reference set.

Therefore, the best match based on visual similarity is:
