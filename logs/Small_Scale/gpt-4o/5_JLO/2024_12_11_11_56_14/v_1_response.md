To find the angle between the two lines in the first image, let's follow these steps:

1. **Visual Inspection**:
   - Notice the angle formed in the original image.
   - This angle is noticeably acute and appears relatively small.

2. **Reference Lines**:
   - Compare the angle in the original image with the reference lines from 1 to 11.
   - Notice that the reference line numbers increase as the angle increases.

3. **Options Evaluation**:
   - **Option 1**: Lines 1 and 4 have a moderate angle.
   - **Option 2**: Lines 1 and 3 have a smaller angle.
   - **Option 3**: Lines 1 and 2 have an even smaller angle.
   - **Option 4**: Lines 1 and 8 have a larger angle.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The angle between the two lines in the first image looks like it matches the smaller angle, as represented by Lines 1 and 3.

With these observations, the closest match for the angle between the original lines is option 2.
