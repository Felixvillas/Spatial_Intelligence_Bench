To determine the angle between the original lines, we can follow these steps:

1. **Visual Analysis**: 
   - Observe the inclination of the lines in the image and determine their approximate angle.

2. **Compare with Reference Lines**:
   - Line pairs in the legend create specific angles. 
   - We need to find a similar angle in the provided options.

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option 1 (Lines 1 and 7)**: This represents a larger angle, about 90 degrees or more.
   - **Option 2 (Lines 1 and 3)**: A smaller angle, likely around 30 degrees.
   - **Option 3 (Lines 1 and 2)**: An even smaller angle, probably around 15 degrees.
   - **Option 4 (Lines 1 and 11)**: Represents approximately 180 degrees, a straight line.

Given the visual assessment, the angle in the image appears to be relatively acute.

Based on this reasoning, the angle appears closest to the angle formed by lines 1 and 3.
