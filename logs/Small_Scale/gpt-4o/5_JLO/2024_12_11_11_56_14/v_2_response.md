To determine the angle between the two lines, we can visually compare the angles of the lines in the original image to the angles between reference lines in the legend.

1. **Original Lines:**
   - Look at the degrees of inclination between the two lines in the original image.

2. **Comparison with Reference Lines:**
   - Observe the angles between pairs of lines in the legend and find which pair closely matches the angle observed in the original image.
   - Each reference line pair given in the options can be estimated for their angle visually.

3. **Matching Process:**
   - When comparing the original image and the legend, it appears that the angle between the original lines most closely resembles the angle between Lines 1 and 7.

Thus, the angle between the lines in the original image closely matches option 2.
