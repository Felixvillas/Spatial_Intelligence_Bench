To determine the angle between the two lines in the first image, we'll compare it visually with the angles formed by the reference lines in the second image. 

1. **Examine the Original Image:**
   - The two lines in the image create an acute angle. 

2. **Analyze the Reference Lines:**
   - Lines in the reference image are numbered from 1 to 11, with line 1 being horizontal and line 6 being vertical. The angles between successive lines are smaller for smaller numbers and larger as you move to a larger number.

3. **Checking Possible Options:**

   - **Option 1: Lines 1 and 7**
     - This forms an angle closer to a right angle, similar to what we have in the original image.
   
   - **Option 2: Lines 1 and 3**
     - This forms a smaller acute angle than observed in the original image.
   
   - **Option 3: Lines 1 and 2**
     - This forms an even smaller acute angle than what is compared from the original image.
   
   - **Option 4: Lines 1 and 11**
     - This forms approximately a straight angle, much larger than the observed angle.

The angle formed between lines 1 and 7 in the legend image closely resembles the angle between the two lines in the original image.
