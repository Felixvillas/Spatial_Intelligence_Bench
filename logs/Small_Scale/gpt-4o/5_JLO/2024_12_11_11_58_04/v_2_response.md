To determine which reference line pair matches the angle between the original lines, follow these steps:

1. **Observe the Original Lines:** Look at the orientation of the two lines in the first image. Visually estimate the angle between them.

2. **Compare with the Legend:** Examine the angles formed by each pair of lines in the legend image.

3. **Line Pair Options:**
   - **Lines 1 and 8:** This pair forms a wide angle, likely more than 90 degrees.
   - **Lines 1 and 7:** This pair forms a slightly smaller angle than 1 and 8, still more than 90 degrees.
   - **Lines 1 and 11:** This pair appears to form a very small angle.
   - **Lines 1 and 4:** This pair represents a narrow angle, less than 90 degrees.

4. **Choose the Closest Pair:** Compare your observation of the original lines with these descriptions. The original lines appear to form an acute angle, likely matching the narrow angle of lines 1 and 4.
