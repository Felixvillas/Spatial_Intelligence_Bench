1. **Analyze the Angle in the First Image:** 
   - The two lines in the original image show a relatively wide angle. 

2. **Compare with Reference Lines:**
   - Use the second image (reference legend) to find the angle that matches with the lines in the original image.
   - Reference line pairs represent different angles. 

3. **Identify the Correct Pair:**
   - Compare the angle between lines in the original image with the angle between the reference lines.
   - Given the options, consider the visual appearance of the angle.

4. **Determine the Best Match:** 
   - The angle in the original image is quite similar to the angle formed by lines 1 and 9 in the reference legend.

In conclusion, the correct reference line pair that matches the angle between the original lines is:
