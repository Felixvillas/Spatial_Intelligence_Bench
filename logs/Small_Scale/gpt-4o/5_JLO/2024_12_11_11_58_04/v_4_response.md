To measure the angle between the two lines in the first image using the reference lines in the second image, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Angle Between the Original Lines**: The two lines appear to be forming an acute angle. Visually estimate the angle and note that it looks less than 90 degrees.

2. **Compare With Reference Lines**: Look at the angles created by different reference lines:
   - **Lines 1 and 3**: Relatively small angle.
   - **Lines 1 and 6**: Appears close to 60 degrees or larger.
   - **Lines 1 and 7**: Significantly larger angle.
   - **Lines 1 and 9**: Approaches a right angle, close to 90 degrees.

3. **Determine the Closest Match**: The original lines in the image are closer to the angle formed between lines 1 and 6 in the reference chart.

Therefore, the angle between the original lines is best matched by the angle formed between reference lines 1 and 6.
