To determine the angle between the two lines in the first image using the reference lines, follow these steps:

1. **Analyze the Image**: Observe the angle formed by the two lines in the image. They are positioned at a relatively acute angle.

2. **Compare with Reference**: Look at the reference legend image. Find the two lines (assuming one as a base line - Line 1) that most closely represent the angle in the original image.

3. **Examine Options**:
   - **Lines 1 and 4**: Moderate angle
   - **Lines 1 and 3**: Slightly smaller angle than 1 and 4
   - **Lines 1 and 2**: Very small angle, almost parallel
   - **Lines 1 and 8**: Very wide angle

4. **Conclusion**: The original lines are at a small angle, so Lines 1 and 3 are the best match.
