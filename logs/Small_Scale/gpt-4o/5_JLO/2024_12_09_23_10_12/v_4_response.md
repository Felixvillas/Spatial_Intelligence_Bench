To determine the angle between the two lines in the given image, I'll match it with the reference lines.

1. **Check the original lines:** Observe the angle formed by the two lines in the first image.
2. **Compare with the reference lines:**
    - Lines 1 and 9 form a wide angle.
    - Lines 1 and 7 form a smaller angle.
    - Lines 1 and 3 form an even smaller angle.
    - Lines 1 and 6 are almost vertical.

The angle between the original lines most closely matches the smaller angle formed by lines 1 and 3 in the reference image.
