To determine the angle between the two lines in the original image, we can compare them visually with the reference lines in the legend. Here¡¯s the step-by-step process:

1. **Analyzing the Original Lines**:
   - The two lines in the original image form an acute angle. 
   - One line is vertical, while the other is slanted towards the right.

2. **Analyzing the Legend**:
   - The legend shows lines at different angles from a horizontal baseline (Line 1).
   - We need to visually compare the slant of the original lines with the angles formed by the lines in the legend in pairs.

3. **Options**:
   - **Lines 1 and 7**: This represents a moderately wide angle.
   - **Lines 1 and 3**: This represents a smaller angle.
   - **Lines 1 and 2**: This represents a very small angle.
   - **Lines 1 and 11**: This represents a very wide angle.

4. **Comparison**:
   - The original lines resemble a configuration between 1 and 3, looking more like a smaller angle compared to the others.

Therefore, based on the visual comparison, the best match seems to be Lines 1 and 3 in the legend.
