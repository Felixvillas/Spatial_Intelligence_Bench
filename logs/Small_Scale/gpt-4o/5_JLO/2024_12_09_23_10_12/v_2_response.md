To determine the angle between the two lines in the original image, observe the orientation of each line and compare each with the reference lines. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Analyze the orientation of the two lines in the original image - they both tilt slightly upward.

2. Compare the orientation of each line with the numbered reference lines to estimate the closest matched angle pair.

3. From the reference lines:
   - Line 1 is horizontal.
   - The angles gradually increase from line 1 to line 11.

4. Observe the choice of pairs:
   - Lines 1 and 8
   - Lines 1 and 7
   - Lines 1 and 11
   - Lines 1 and 4

5. The original image's lines appear to form a relatively moderate angle, suggesting the pair might be around 7 or 8 since lines 2 and 3 represent smaller angles and 9 and above larger angles.

Based on this analysis, the best estimate for the angle between the original lines, when matched to the reference pairs, is option 2, Lines 1 and 7.
