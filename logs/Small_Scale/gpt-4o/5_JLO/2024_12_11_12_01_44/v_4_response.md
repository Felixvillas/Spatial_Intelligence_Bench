To solve the problem, let's analyze the images step by step.

1. **Identify Line Directions:**
   - In the first image, observe the directions of the two lines. One line appears to be more vertical, while the other is more horizontal.

2. **Reference Comparison:**
   - Using the reference lines from the second image, compare each pair of lines with the angle formed by the lines in the first image.

3. **Analyze Each Option:**
   - **Option 1 (Lines 1 and 9):** These lines form a relatively shallow angle.
   - **Option 2 (Lines 1 and 7):** These lines form an angle that is moderately less than perpendicular.
   - **Option 3 (Lines 1 and 3):** These lines form a relatively sharp angle.
   - **Option 4 (Lines 1 and 6):** These lines form a perpendicular angle.

4. **Estimate the Angle:**
   - From the first image, the angle seems moderately inclined, suggesting that option 2 (Lines 1 and 7) is the closest match as it's not overly sharp or perpendicular.

Given this step-by-step analysis, the angle between the lines in the first image most closely matches the angle formed by lines 1 and 7 from the reference image.
