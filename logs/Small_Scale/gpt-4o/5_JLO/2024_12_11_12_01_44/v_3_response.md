To determine the angle between the two lines shown in the first image, let's follow these steps:

1. **Assess the Angle**: The two lines appear to be at a relatively steep angle from each other.

2. **Compare with the Reference Legend**:
   - In the legend, line 1 is horizontal at the bottom.
   - Each line moving upwards represents an increasing angle from the horizontal.
   - Line 3 is at a smaller angle than Line 9, 7, or 6.
   - Lines 9 and 7 are more vertical compared to lines 3 and 6.

3. **Match the Angle**:
   - The angle between the original two lines seems closer to the angle between Line 1 and Line 7 given their steepness.

Following this analysis:
