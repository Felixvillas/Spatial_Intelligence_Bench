To determine the angle between the two lines in the first image, let's assess their orientation and then compare it with the reference lines.

1. **Identify Line Orientation in the Image:**  
   The two lines in the image form an acute angle, where one line appears more vertical and the other line more horizontal. 

2. **Examine Reference Lines:**  
   - Reference lines numbered from 1 to 11 offer a range of angles:
     - Lines 1 to 3 are much closer to horizontal.
     - Lines 4 to 5 are more diagonal.
     - Line 6 is vertical.
     - Lines 7 to 11 trend back to horizontal in the opposite direction.
 
3. **Compare Lines:**  
   - The pair of lines in the image best aligns with one line being similar to reference Line 3 and the other to Line 9 or Line 10.
   - Therefore, we are looking at a situation more like reference Lines 1 and 3 than the more acute angles implied by Lines 1 and 2.

From these observations, the pair of reference lines that most closely match the angle between the original lines appear to be Lines 1 and 3.
