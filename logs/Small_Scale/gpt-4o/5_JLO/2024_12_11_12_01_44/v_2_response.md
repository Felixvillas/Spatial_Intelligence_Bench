To solve the problem step by step:

1. **Visualize the Original Lines**: Observe the slant and orientation of the two lines in the first image.

2. **Compare with the Legend**: Examine the angles formed by the reference lines in the legend image to match with the original lines.

3. **Slant of the Lines**: 
    - The original lines have a slight upward slope and are not very steep.
    - Among the options provided, these properties seem closest to the arrangement of lines in option 2.

4. **Evaluate Options**:
    - **Option 1 (Lines 1 and 8)**: Wider angle, not matching.
    - **Option 2 (Lines 1 and 7)**: Matches the slight upward slopes.
    - **Option 3 (Lines 1 and 11)**: Only one upward slant, not matching.
    - **Option 4 (Lines 1 and 4)**: Doesn't match the arrangement well.

5. **Conclusion**: Among the options, the angles of "Lines 1 and 7" best match the orientation of the original lines.
