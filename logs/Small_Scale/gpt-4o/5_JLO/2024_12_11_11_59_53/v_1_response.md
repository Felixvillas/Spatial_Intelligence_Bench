To determine the angle between the two lines in the first image, we need to compare their orientation with the reference lines provided in the legend.

1. The first image shows two lines intersecting at an angle.
2. Using the reference lines:
   - Lines 1 and 2 represent a smaller angle.
   - Lines 1 and 3 represent a slightly larger angle.
   - Lines 1 and 4 represent an even larger angle.
   - Lines 1 and 8 represent a much larger angle.

Upon visual inspection, the angle in the first image seems to match the angle formed by the reference lines 1 and 3.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
