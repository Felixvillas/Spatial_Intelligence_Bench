To determine the angle between the two lines in the image, we'll compare them to the reference lines given in the legend. The process involves:

1. **Identifying the Orientation of the Lines**: 
   - Observe the angle between the two lines in the initial image.
   - Compare these with the angles created by the numbered reference lines in the legend image.

2. **Matching the Angles**:
   - Compare the orientation of the initial lines to pairs of reference lines provided in the options.

3. **Analyze Each Option**:
   - **Option 1: Lines 1 and 9**: Large angle, closer to horizontal spread.
   - **Option 2: Lines 1 and 7**: Moderately spread angle.
   - **Option 3: Lines 1 and 3**: Smaller angle.
   - **Option 4: Lines 1 and 6**: Nearly vertical, smaller angle.

After observing, the angle between the lines in the initial image most closely resembles option 2.
