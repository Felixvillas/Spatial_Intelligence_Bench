To determine the angle between the two lines in the image, we need to compare their orientation with the reference lines in the legend.

1. **Visual Analysis**: 
   - In the given image, the two lines are slightly tilted and diverge from left to right.
   - The goal is to find the pair of reference lines that have a similar angle with each other.

2. **Reference Lines**:
   - Review the positions of the reference lines in the legend.
   - Lines 1 and 11 form a completely flat angle.
   - Lines 1 and 8 form a wider angle than lines 1 and 7.
   - Lines 1 and 4 form a slightly narrower angle compared to lines 1 and 7.

3. **Angle Matching**:
   - Compare the divergence of the lines in the given image to the angle in the legend.
   - The lines appear to have a similar divergence as the angles formed by lines 1 and 7 in the legend.

Given the above observations, the pair of reference lines that most closely match the angle between the lines in the original image is the pair consisting of lines 1 and 7.
