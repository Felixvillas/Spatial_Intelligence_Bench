To measure the angle between the two lines in the first image, we should compare it with the reference lines in the second image.

**Step 1: Analyze the lines in the first image.**
- Observe the two lines: one is mostly vertical, and the other is angled to the right.
- Estimate the angle between these lines visually.

**Step 2: Assess the reference lines.**
- Lines in the second image show various angles. 
- Look at the separation between line numbers in the reference image.

**Step 3: Match the angles.**
- Line pair 1 and 7 has the widest span.
- Line pair 1 and 3 has a smaller angle.
- Line pair 1 and 2 has the smallest angle.
- Line pair 1 and 11 has a medium angle.

The angle in the first image appears to be more than a small angle (like lines 1 and 2) but less than a wide span (like lines 1 and 7). It is most similar to the medium range provided by line pair 1 and 11.

Considering all the steps above, the angles in the first image most closely resemble:
