To determine the angle between the two lines in the image, we need to compare them to the reference lines provided in the legend.

Step 1: Observe the angles between the lines in the initial image.

Step 2: Compare these angles with the numbered lines in the legend.

Step 3: Determine which pair of reference lines most closely matches the angle between the original lines.

After closely comparing the angles:

- The lines in the initial image appear to form a smaller angle, closest to the pair of reference lines 1 and 3 from the legend.

Thus, the correct answer is choice 3.
