To solve this puzzle and determine which choice shows the correct assembly of the pieces shown, we should observe the shapes and edges closely:

1. **Identify the unique triangle piece** and ensure it matches with each option.
2. **Look at the angles and sides** of all pieces to see how they fit together in the choices.
3. Eliminate options that do not fit due to mismatched angles or alignments.

By comparing each choice with these considerations:

- **Choice 1**: The triangle does not fit well with the available edges.
- **Choice 2**: The orientations don¡¯t align as all pieces are not together correctly.
- **Choice 3**: This seems to match perfectly where the triangle and other shapes align well.
- **Choice 4**: Similar to Choice 3, but slight misalignment.

Thus, the correct positioning of the pieces aligns with **Choice 3**.
