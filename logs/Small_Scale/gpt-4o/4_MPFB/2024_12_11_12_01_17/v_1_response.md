To solve this, let's examine the shapes and how they are fitted together:

1. **Identify Shapes:**
   - There are five pieces: one triangle, one small quadrilateral, and three larger quadrilaterals.

2. **Check Each Option:**
   - Identify the fitting of each piece and verify if all pieces are used properly.

3. **Choice 1:**
   - This option does not seem to match the shapes well, with gaps when considering the given pieces.

4. **Choice 2:**
   - Looks like it correctly uses all pieces, with the triangle fitting in the bottom right.

5. **Choice 3:**
   - The pieces don't seem to align well in this choice.

6. **Choice 4:**
   - Similar to Choice 3, the alignment and fitting of pieces don¡¯t appear correct.

After examining each option, **Choice 2** seems to correctly fit all the pieces together properly.
