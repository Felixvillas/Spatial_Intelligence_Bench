To determine which option shows the puzzle pieces put together, let's analyze each piece and how they fit together.

1. **Original Pieces**: There are three distinct puzzle pieces.
2. **Shape Matching**: 
   - The top piece looks like it forms the top section of a circle.
   - The bottom piece seems to complete the lower section of the circle.
   - The small insert fits inside the top section.

3. **Option Evaluation**:
   - **Choice 1**: Does not fit the shape of the top or bottom pieces.
   - **Choice 2**: Does not have the necessary contour to match the pieces.
   - **Choice 3**: Similar issue; the pieces don't align properly.
   - **Choice 4**: Matches the positioning of three distinct puzzle pieces, fitting into a circular shape as required.

Hence, the correct arrangement is depicted by Choice 4.
