To solve this, let's analyze the pieces step by step and see how they fit together:

1. **Identify Pieces:**
   - Six pieces of different polygon shapes are given.

2. **Analyze Each Choice for Each Piece:**
   - Choice 1: Seems to have mismatching lines.
   - Choice 2: Visually seems like the edges align well.
   - Choice 3: Also appears like edges align, but scrutiny needed.
   - Choice 4: Edges look like they align correctly.

3. **Comparison:** 
   - Considering the shapes of each piece and try placing them mentally:
     - Choice 2 and Choice 4 have a square structure that matches.
     - Further scrutiny might show misalignments for Choice 4.
   
4. **Confirm Final Layout:**
   - Close look needed for Choice 2 and Choice 4:
   - Choice 4 aligns better after checking the lines and angles.

Given the above steps, let's choose the best fit:
