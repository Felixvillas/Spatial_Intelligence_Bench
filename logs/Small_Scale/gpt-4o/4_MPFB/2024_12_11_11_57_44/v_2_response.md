To solve the puzzle, let's match each individual piece to the configurations in the choices. 

1. **Identify the pieces:**
   - There are 6 pieces with distinct shapes and angles.
   
2. **Analyze each choice:**
   - **Choice 1:** Look at the connections and formation. The longest piece seems inaccurately aligned compared to the original pieces.
   - **Choice 2:** All pieces seem to fit together well, maintaining the original angles and edges correctly.
   - **Choice 3:** Some pieces do not align as smoothly, particularly the small angled piece.
   - **Choice 4:** Similar issues to Choice 3 with piece misalignment.

3. **Consider the shapes and angles:** The angles and edges in Choice 2 match better with the original pieces.

Therefore, the correct configuration is Choice 2.
