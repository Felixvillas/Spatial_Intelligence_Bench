To solve the puzzle, we'll analyze the shape and orientation of each piece to see how they fit together in the choices provided.

1. **Examine the Given Pieces:**
   - There are five distinct pieces: two quadrilaterals and three triangles of varying shapes and sizes.

2. **Assess Each Choice:**
   - Look at how these pieces can fit to form a larger, cohesive shape.

3. **Identify Correct Choice:**
   - Choice 1, 2, and 3 don't seem to fit the pieces together logically, as they either leave gaps or misalign the shapes.
   - Choice 4 arranges the quadrilaterals and triangles in a coherent manner that uses all the pieces without overlapping or leaving gaps.

Based on visual inspection, the pieces fit together correctly in **Choice 4**.
