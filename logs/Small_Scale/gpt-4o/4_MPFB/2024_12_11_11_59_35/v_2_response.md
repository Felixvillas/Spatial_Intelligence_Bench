To solve the puzzle, let's analyze the shapes and how they fit together:

1. **Identify Pieces**: There are five shapes that need to be arranged into a larger rectangle.
2. **Shape Matching**: Each choice offers a possible arrangement, so we need to determine which one incorporates all pieces correctly without overlap or missing parts.

By examining each choice:
- **Choice 1**: Does not match as one of the large trapezoid pieces appears to be wrongly oriented.
- **Choice 2**: Incorrect alignment of pieces.
- **Choice 3**: Incorrect configuration.
- **Choice 4**: All pieces fit together correctly to form a perfect rectangle.

Thus, the correct choice where all pieces fit is Choice 4.
