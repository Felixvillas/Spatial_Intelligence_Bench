To determine which choice correctly shows the puzzle pieces assembled, let's analyze the image step by step:

1. **Identify shapes and their orientation:**
   - There are four pieces: three quadrilaterals and one small triangle.

2. **Match each piece with possibilities:**
   - Ensure the pieces fit together without overlapping and exactly fill the square.

3. **Review each choice:**
   - **Choice 1:** Does not fit perfectly as one piece is not aligned correctly.
   - **Choice 2, 3, 4:** Analyze each to see if they fit properly without gaps or overlaps.

4. **Select the correct choice:**
   - **Choice 4** fits all pieces together perfectly without any gaps or misalignment.

Thus, the correctly assembled puzzle is Choice 4.
