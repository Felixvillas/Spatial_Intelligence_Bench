To solve this puzzle, we need to visualize how each piece fits together based on its shape and orientation. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. Examine each individual piece of the puzzle to understand their distinct shapes and angles.

2. Look at each option (Choice 1 to Choice 4) and identify the positioning of the pieces according to their matching sides and angles.

3. Compare the shapes in the given choices with each piece's shape from the puzzle. We need to ensure that all pieces fit together perfectly to form a complete square or shape.

Upon careful inspection, Choice 1 has the pieces fitting perfectly together to form a complete square where each piece aligns correctly with the corresponding sides and angles.
