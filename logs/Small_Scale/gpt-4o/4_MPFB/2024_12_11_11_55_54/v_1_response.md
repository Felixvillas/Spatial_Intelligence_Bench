To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the shape of each piece and see how they fit together into a square.

1. **Identify the pieces**: 
    - There are three quadrilaterals and one triangle.
    
2. **Check each choice for fit**:
    - Each choice shows a set of pieces tightly fitting together into a square.
    
3. **Match the pieces to the choices**:
    - **Choice 2** fits the pieces nicely together into a square.
    - The quadrilaterals create the bulk of the square, and the triangle fills the remaining gap perfectly.

Therefore, the correct arrangement is **Choice 2**.
