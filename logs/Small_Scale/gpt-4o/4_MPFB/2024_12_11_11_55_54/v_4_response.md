To solve the puzzle, let's analyze the pieces and see how they fit together:

1. **The top piece** resembles a curved rectangle with a flat base.
2. **The small piece** is a thin crescent shape.
3. **The bottom piece** is a curved semicircle with a flat top.

Now, let's consider the options:

- **Choice 1 and 2**: Both contain more complex curve interactions and none integrate a thin crescent shape as seen in the pieces.
- **Choice 3**: This has two curved pieces that don¡¯t match the provided shapes.
- **Choice 4**: This option features a small crescent shape fitting in the top section, aligning with the small piece, and a semicircle piece that matches the bottom piece.

Looking at the individual piece shapes and their potential arrangement, **Choice 4** matches perfectly with the provided pieces.
