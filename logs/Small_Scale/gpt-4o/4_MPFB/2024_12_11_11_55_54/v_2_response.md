To find the correct fitting of the puzzle pieces, we need to consider both the shapes and orientation of the individual pieces. Let¡¯s go through each choice:

1. **Choice 1:** The large parallelogram piece does not fit smoothly; the orientations of the smaller pieces don't allow a seamless fill.

2. **Choice 2:** The configuration of pieces is better but still does not resemble the exact fitting required by the outer shape, mainly due to how the pieces overlap and align.

3. **Choice 3:** This choice features several overlaps and misalignments, especially near the bottom of the shape.

4. **Choice 4:** The pieces fit snugly without overlap, filling in the square shape efficiently and matching the individual shapes provided.

After analyzing each configuration, **Choice 4** matches exactly how the puzzle pieces can be assembled without gaps or overlaps in the defined arrangement.
