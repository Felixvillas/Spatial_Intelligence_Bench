To determine which option shows the correct assembly of the puzzle pieces:

1. **Identify** the shapes of each puzzle piece and observe their orientations.
2. **Compare** the assembly options against these observed shapes.

- There are five pieces in the original image: four quadrilaterals and one triangle.
- Each choice option forms a square.

Let's evaluate the options step by step:

- **Check Choice 1:** 
  - Triangular piece and quadrilateral pieces placement do not match the original piece shapes.

- **Check Choice 2:** 
  - Layout matches the individual shapes; all pieces fit.

- **Check Choice 3:** 
  - Layout doesn't correctly use two of the quadrilateral pieces.

- **Check Choice 4:** 
  - All shapes properly aligned and accounted for.

Based on the assessment, the correct choice is **Choice 2**.
