To determine which option correctly represents the assembled puzzle pieces, let's examine the shapes and their relative positions:

1. The original image contains five pieces, which are likely to fit together to form a square or rectangle.
2. In the given choices, we need to match these pieces according to their shapes and orientation.

Choices 2 and 4 both can potentially work based on the arrangement of pieces, as they show a square. Upon closer inspection, observe that:

- In the images, the long, narrow triangle (smallest shape) is fit correctly with larger shapes in choices 2 and 4.
- Among these, choice 4 maintains the correct position of the pieces without excess overlap or gaps.

Hence, the correct answer is choice 4.
