To solve this puzzle, we need to fit all the pieces from the first image into a square. Let's evaluate each choice based on the shapes of the individual pieces and how they fit together:

1. **Identify the Pieces:**
   - There's a quadrilateral, a right-angled triangle, and smaller polygonal pieces.

2. **Analyze Each Choice:**
   - **Choice 1:** The placement and angles of the pieces do not match the given shapes.
   - **Choice 2:** The configuration of the pieces resembles possible fits, but the fit isn't exact.
   - **Choice 3:** The pieces fit the space well and resemble the different angles and sides seen in the original pieces.
   - **Choice 4:** Similar to Choice 3, but with slightly different positioning.

3. **Verify Correct Fit:**
   - **Choice 3** appears to have all the pieces properly aligned, with each piece accurately placed to form a perfect square.

After checking the piece shapes and comparing each choice, the correct option where all pieces fit into a cohesive square is Choice 3.
