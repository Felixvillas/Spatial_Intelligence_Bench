To escape the maze, I'll identify the navigable path from the top left to the bottom right using the blue spaces.

1. Start from the current position in the top left corner.
2. Move to the right along the clear path until a wall or an intersection is reached.
3. From intersections, choose the path that progresses downward and toward the bottom right, avoiding impasses.

Following this reasoning, I would take the following actions (assuming clear horizontal and vertical paths):

- Start by moving **right**. 

Here's the action:

```json
{
    "action": "right"
}
```
