First, let's identify the sequence of taps from the video frames:

1. The first yellow box is at the bottom right, which corresponds to box 1.
2. The second yellow box is in the middle, which corresponds to box 4.
3. The third yellow box is at the top left, which corresponds to box 2.
4. The fourth yellow box is at the middle right, which corresponds to box 6.
5. The fifth yellow box is at the bottom left, which corresponds to box 0.
6. The sixth yellow box is at the middle left, which corresponds to box 5.

Now, matching this sequence to the choices given:

- Choice (1): 1, 4, 2, 6, 0, 5

Thus, the correct sequence matches choice (1).
