To determine the correct sequence of taps, let's go through each image frame by frame:

1. **First Image**: Box 1 is highlighted (lower left).
2. **Second Image**: Box 2 is highlighted (middle left).
3. **Third Image**: Box 4 is highlighted (top center).
4. **Fourth Image**: Box 0 is highlighted (lower right).
5. **Fifth Image**: Box 3 is highlighted (center).

The sequence based on these observations is 1, 2, 4, 0, 3.

Using the choice options, the sequence matches option (4).
