Let's analyze the sequence of taps:

1. **Image 1** shows the top-left corner being tapped, which corresponds to index (0, 0).
2. **Image 2** shows the middle of the second row being tapped, which corresponds to index (2, 1).
3. **Image 3** shows the bottom-right corner being tapped, which corresponds to index (3, 2).
4. **Image 4** shows the same position as Image 2 being tapped again, which corresponds to index (2, 1).
5. **Image 5** shows the middle of the top row being tapped, which corresponds to index (1, 1).

Now, compare this with the given choices:

- **Choice 1**: (0, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1)

This matches the sequence described above.
