To determine the correct sequence of taps, let's match the highlighted boxes in each image to the numbered reference image:

1. The first image highlights box 6.
2. The second image highlights box 4.
3. The third image highlights box 2.
4. The fourth image highlights box 5.
5. The fifth image highlights box 0.
6. The sixth image repeats box 4.

Using the numbered reference image, the correct sequence is: 6, 4, 2, 5, 0, 4.

Let's compare this sequence to the given choices:

(1) 1, 4, 2, 6, 0, 5 
(2) 2, 0, 6, 4, 1, 5
(3) 0, 4, 1, 5, 3, 2
(4) 1, 4, 2, 6, 5, 0 

The sequence from our observation (6, 4, 2, 5, 0) matches none of the given choices exactly.

Assuming a review mistake, please make sure the video sequence matches correctly again.
