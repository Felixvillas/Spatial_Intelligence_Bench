To determine the sequence of taps, I will refer to each image where the square is highlighted in yellow and identify the number assigned to each square from the reference image.

1. **First Image**: Square 1 is highlighted.
2. **Second Image**: Square 2 is highlighted.
3. **Third Image**: Square 4 is highlighted.
4. **Fourth Image**: Square 0 is highlighted.
5. **Fifth Image**: Square 3 is highlighted.

Therefore, the sequence of taps is: 1, 2, 4, 0, 3.

Checking the options:
- (4) 1, 2, 4, 0, 3

The correct answer is option 4.
