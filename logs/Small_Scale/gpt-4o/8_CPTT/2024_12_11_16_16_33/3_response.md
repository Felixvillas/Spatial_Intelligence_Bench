To solve this, let's go through each image one by one:

1. **First Image**: The apple is in the second row, first column. That corresponds to index (1, 0).

2. **Second Image**: The apple is in the first row, second column. That corresponds to index (0, 1).

3. **Third Image**: The apple is in the second row, fourth column. That corresponds to index (1, 3).

4. **Fourth Image**: The apple is in the third row, fourth column. That corresponds to index (2, 3).

5. **Fifth Image**: The apple is in the second row, third column. That corresponds to index (1, 2).

So the sequence is: (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), (1, 2).

This matches with choice (2).
