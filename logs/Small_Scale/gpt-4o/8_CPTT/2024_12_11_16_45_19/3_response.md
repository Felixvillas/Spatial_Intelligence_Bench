To solve this, we'll go through each image and note the position of the apple. The grid is 4x4, and indexing starts from the top-left corner as (0, 0).

1. Image 1: The apple is at position (1, 0).
2. Image 2: The apple is at position (0, 1).
3. Image 3: The apple is at position (1, 3).
4. Image 4: The apple is at position (2, 3).
5. Image 5: The apple is at position (1, 2).

The sequence we derived is: (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3), (1, 2).

Now we compare this with the choices:

- Choice (2) matches our sequence.

So, the answer is:

    "answer": 2
