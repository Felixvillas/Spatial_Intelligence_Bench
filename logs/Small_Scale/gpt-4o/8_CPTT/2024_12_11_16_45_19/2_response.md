1. **First Frame:** Box 1 is highlighted.
2. **Second Frame:** Box 2 is highlighted.
3. **Third Frame:** Box 4 is highlighted.
4. **Fourth Frame:** Box 0 is highlighted.
5. **Fifth Frame:** Box 3 is highlighted.

The sequence based on these observations is: 1, 2, 4, 0, 3.

Let's match this with the given choices:

(1) 1, 2, 4, 3, 0  
(2) 1, 3, 2, 4, 0  
(3) 2, 4, 6, 0, 3
