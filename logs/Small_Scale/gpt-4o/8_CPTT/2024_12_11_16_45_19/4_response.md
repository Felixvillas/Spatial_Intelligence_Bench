To solve this, let's analyze the sequence shown in each image:

1. The first tap is on the top-left box, corresponding to index **(0, 0)**.
2. The second tap is on the third row, second column, corresponding to index **(2, 1)**.
3. The third tap is on the fourth row, third column, corresponding to index **(3, 2)**.
4. The fourth tap goes back to the third row, second column, corresponding to index **(2, 1)**.
5. The fifth tap is on the second row, second column, corresponding to index **(1, 1)**.

Thus, the correct sequence is:

- (0, 0)
- (2, 1)
- (3, 2)
- (2, 1)
- (1, 1)

Matching this sequence to the choices provided, it corresponds to the first choice:

(1) (0, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (2, 1), (1, 1)
