To solve this, let's analyze the grid step by step and compare each candy to the target image.

1. **Target Candy Features:**
   - The target candy has a split color design (blue and green).
   - The target candy has three appendage-like shapes, two on one side and one on the other.

2. **Locate the Target Candy in the Grid:**
   - Look for candies matching the split color design and shape of the target.

**Row 0:**
- (0, 0) matches the target.
- No other candies in row 0 match the target.

**Row 1:**
- (1, 3) matches the target.

**Row 2:**
- (2, 3) matches the target.

**Row 3:**
- (3, 3) matches the target.

Now, check which choice matches all these coordinates:

- **Choice 3:** (0, 0), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)

These are the correct positions of the target candy.
