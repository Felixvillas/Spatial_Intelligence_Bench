First, let's analyze the target apple in the first image:

- It's a simple illustration with a red body and a single green leaf and black outline.

Now, let's identify the matching apples in the grid, ensuring they share the same style and characteristics:

1. **(0, 4)**: Matches the target. 
2. **(1, 2)**: Matches the target.
3. **(2, 2)**: Matches the target.
4. **(3, 2)**: Matches the target.
5. **(4, 0)**: Matches the target.

By analyzing the match locations, Option 4 correctly lists all these positions.
