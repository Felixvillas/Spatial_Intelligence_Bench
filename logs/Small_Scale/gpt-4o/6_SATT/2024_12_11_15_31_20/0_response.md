To find the correct locations of the target object in the grid, we need to compare each tree in the grid to the target tree given.

1. **Target Description:**
   - The target tree has a simple design with a single trunk and a leafy top that looks like a basic outline of a tree.
   
2. **Grid Analysis:**
   - Look at each row and column to identify which trees match the description of the target.
   - The target trees are located as follows:
     - (0, 5): Matches the target tree.
     - (1, 3): Matches the target tree.
     - (2, 1): Matches the target tree.
     - (3, 3): Matches the target tree.
     - (4, 4): Matches the target tree.
     - (5, 4): Matches the target tree.

3. **Validation:**
   - Compare the identified target locations with the choices given:
     - Choice 1: (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5) - Last one is incorrect.
     - Choice 2: (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 0), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4) - Second one is incorrect.
     - **Choice 3: (0, 5), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 4) - All correct.**
     - Choice 4: (0, 5), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 3), (4, 1), (5, 5) - Second and last ones are incorrect.

Based on the comparison and validation, the correct choice is:
