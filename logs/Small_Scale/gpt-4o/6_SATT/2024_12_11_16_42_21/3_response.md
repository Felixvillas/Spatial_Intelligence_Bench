Let's identify the positions of the target object in the grid step by step by comparing each apple in the grid with the target image.

- The target object is defined by its unique shape, color, and leaf position.
- We visually inspect each candidate against these criteria to determine a match.

Analyzing the images, we find the matches at the following positions:

1. (0, 4)
2. (1, 2)
3. (2, 2)
4. (3, 2)
5. (4, 0)

Now, match this list of positions with the provided choices:

- Choice 1: Matches at (0, 0), which is incorrect.
- Choice 2: Matches at (4, 3), which is incorrect.
- Choice 3: Matches perfectly.
- Choice 4: Matches at (4, 0), which is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct choice is Choice 3.
