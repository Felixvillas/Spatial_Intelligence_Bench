To identify the locations of the target shoe in the grid, let's analyze the features of the target image:

1. The target shoe is orange with a star on the side and has two velcro straps.
2. The shoes in the grid must match this design.

Now, let's check each choice:

- **Choice 1: (0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 1), (3, 1)**
  - (0, 3): Matches the target (orange, star, velcro straps)
  - (1, 3): Does not match (wrong shoe type)
  - (2, 1): Matches the target
  - (3, 1): Matches the target

- **Choice 2: (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0)**
  - (0, 3): Matches the target
  - (1, 0): Does not match (design is different)
  - (2, 1): Matches the target
  - (3, 0): Does not match (wrong shoe type)

- **Choice 3: (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 3)**
  - (0, 3): Matches the target
  - (1, 2): Does not match (wrong shoe type)
  - (2, 1): Matches the target
  - (3, 3): Does not exist

- **Choice 4: (0, 3), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1)**
  - (0, 3): Matches the target
  - (1, 0): Does not match (design is different)
  - (2, 1): Matches the target
  - (3, 1): Matches the target

Based on the above analysis, the only correct locations matching the target shoe are in **Choice 1**.
