To determine which image shows the same object as the original, rotated in 3D, we'll analyze the shape and orientation:

- The original image is composed of four connected cubes, forming a zig-zag shape with three bends. It starts left horizontally, then goes up diagonally, and finally continues horizontally again.

Now, comparing this structure with the choices:

1. **Choice 1**:
   - The shape has a similar zig-zag structure, but the first segment does not start in the same position.

2. **Choice 2**:
   - This has a straight vertical structure with a top that doesn't match the original shape.

3. **Choice 3**:
   - The sequence of cubes matches the original configuration perfectly, but with a different 3D orientation. This choice is consistent with a rotated version of the original.

4. **Choice 4**:
   - The shape does not match the configuration of the original shape.

Based on this analysis, Choice 3 correctly shows the same object rotated in 3D.
