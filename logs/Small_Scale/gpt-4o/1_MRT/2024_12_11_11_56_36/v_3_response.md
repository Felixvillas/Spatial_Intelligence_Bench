To determine which image shows the same object rotated, let's analyze the shape:

1. The original shape has one straight section with two cubes at an angle at the top and the bottom.
2. The cubes are aligned in a sequence of single cubes, making a corner and then continuing in a straight line.

Now, let's evaluate each choice:

- **Choice 1:** The arrangement of cubes matches the original shape, with the rotation showing a valid perspective.
- **Choice 2:** Appears to have an extra cube that doesn't match the original shape.
- **Choice 3:** The angle and arrangement look different from the original shape.
- **Choice 4:** The perspective seems different from the original shape with an incorrect arrangement.

Choice 1 accurately represents the rotated version of the original object.
