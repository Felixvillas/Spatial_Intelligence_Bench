To determine which choice shows the same object rotated in 3D, let's analyze the structure of the original shape and each choice.

The original shape consists of:

- A line of 4 cubes forming a base.
- A vertical column of 3 cubes extending from one end of this base.
- Another column of 2 cubes extending from the middle of the base in the opposite direction.

Let's examine each choice:

1. **Choice 1**: 
   - Has a line of 4 cubes and vertical columns of 3 and 2 cubes but is oriented differently.
   - Matches the structure but rotated.

2. **Choice 2**: 
   - Appears to have a different arrangement of cubes. Does not match.

3. **Choice 3**: 
   - Matches the structure. Shows the same shape rotated, similar to Choice 1.

4. **Choice 4**: 
   - Appears to have the same structure but oriented differently.

Choice 1 and Choice 3 show the same structure rotated in 3D. 

Since we're choosing one:
