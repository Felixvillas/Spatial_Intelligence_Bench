To identify the matching shape, we will analyze the structure of the original shape and then compare it with each choice.

1. **Original Shape Analysis:**
   - The shape forms a 3D "L" structure.
   - It consists of two main sections:
     - One section has a 2x1x1 block on the end.
     - Another section has a 1x1x1 block on the end.
   - These sections are connected by a single 1x1x1 cube.

2. **Choice 1 Analysis:**
   - This choice does not match the original shape because it has a different structure. The arrangement and orientation of the blocks do not create the same 3D ¡°L¡± shape.

3. **Choice 2 Analysis:**
   - This choice does not match. The blocks seem to be rotated in a way that doesn't reproduce the original structure.

4. **Choice 3 Analysis:**
   - This choice matches the original shape. The arrangement and orientation of the blocks form the same 3D ¡°L¡± shape as in the original image.

5. **Choice 4 Analysis:**
   - This choice does not match. The orientation doesn¡¯t match the ¡°L¡± shape arrangement.

Therefore, the shape that matches the original when rotated is **Choice 3**.
