To determine which choice shows the same object rotated in 3D, let's analyze the initial shape and each choice:

1. **Initial Shape**: 
   - It's an L-shaped structure made of cubes: a horizontal line with 4 cubes connected at a 90-degree angle to another line of 2 cubes.

2. **Analyze Choices**:
   - **Choice 1**: The cubes form an S-shaped figure, which does not match the L-shape.
   - **Choice 2**: The structure here has a direction change, but there are no sections with 4 cubes in a line.
   - **Choice 3**: The arrangement and number of cubes match the L-shape. Rotated, it forms an L-shaped figure similar to the initial image.
   - **Choice 4**: This shape has a longer arm, made of 5 cubes in a row, which doesn't match.

Therefore, Choice 3 shows the same object rotated in 3D.
