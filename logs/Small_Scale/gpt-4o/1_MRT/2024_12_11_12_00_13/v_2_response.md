To determine which choice shows the same three-dimensional shape rotated, let's compare each choice to the original image:

1. **Shape Structure**: The shape in the original image has a bend that creates a distinctive pattern with parallel segments and connecting segments, forming a ¡°Z¡± shape.

2. **Comparison of Each Choice**:

   - **Choice 1**: The shape has more bends and doesn't match the same shape configuration. It's not just rotated¡ªit has different angles.
   
   - **Choice 2**: The shape has the same apparent structural form with the same number of segments and bends. It appears to be the shape rotated in another view.
   
   - **Choice 3**: The configuration looks similar but doesn¡¯t have the same distinctive bend pattern as the original¡ªit appears stretched differently.
   
   - **Choice 4**: The overall structure, with similar bends and alignment of the segments, looks like the original shape rotated. 

3. **Conclusion**: Choices 2 and 4 show the same shape rotated in 3D.
