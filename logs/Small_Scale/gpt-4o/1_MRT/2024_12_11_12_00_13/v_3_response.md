To compare the original image with each choice, we need to pay attention to the configuration of the blocks:

1. **Original Shape Layout:**
   - The structure consists of a series of connected cubes forming an L shape with an additional set on top.

2. **Comparison Steps:**
   - **Choice 1:** This image shows a structure where the configuration of cubes does not match the original.
   - **Choice 2:** The configuration matches the original shape when rotated. It maintains the 'L' orientation with the extra cubes.
   - **Choice 3:** This configuration does not match the original shape's pattern when rotated.
   - **Choice 4:** The order and orientation of the cubes are different from the original.

Choice 2 is the correct match after rotation.
