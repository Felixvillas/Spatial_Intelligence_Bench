To identify the image that represents the same object rotated in 3D, let's analyze the original shape:

1. The original 3D object has:
   - A main long section consisting of 5 cubes in a linear formation.
   - A perpendicular section consisting of 3 cubes branching out at one end.

Now, let's evaluate the choices:

- **Choice 1:**
  - The arrangement of cubes resembles three separate sections but doesn't match the specific orientation of the main section with the branch off the end.

- **Choice 2:**
  - The shape here also doesn't align with the branching section pattern. The angles and turns are different.

- **Choice 3:**
  - This shape closely matches the original but rotated orientation, maintaining the important aspect of a linear section with a branching part.

- **Choice 4:**
  - The configuration shows a different alignment, both in the main section and the branching part.

Thus, the image in **Choice 3** accurately represents the original shape, just rotated.
