To determine which image shows the same object rotated in 3D, let's follow these steps:

1. **Analyze the Original Shape:**
   - The original shape seems to have a 2x1 block on one end, a 3x1 block in the middle, and another 2x1 block on the opposite end, forming a bent or "L" shape.

2. **Examine Each Choice:**
   - **Choice 1:** The shape is not consistent with the original as it appears to have an incorrect block configuration.
   - **Choice 2:** The orientation of blocks doesn't match the original "L" shape.
   - **Choice 3:** This shape matches the orientation and structure of the original shape.
   - **Choice 4:** Appears to be rotated differently, not matching the original.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - **Choice 3** is the correct representation, as it has the same block configuration and alignment as the original shape.
