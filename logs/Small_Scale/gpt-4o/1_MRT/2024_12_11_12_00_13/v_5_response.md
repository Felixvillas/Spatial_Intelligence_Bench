To determine which choice shows the same object rotated in 3D, let's analyze each shape:

1. **Original Shape**: It has an L-shape when looking at the side. There are two vertical sections and three horizontal sections connected to it.
2. **Choice 1**: The structure is aligned differently. The orientation shows both sections visible, but they don't match the original shape's configuration.
3. **Choice 2**: This choice also doesn't match the original structure's specifications upon rotation.
4. **Choice 3**: This shape looks similar to the original. Both vertical and horizontal sections match when considering a rotated view.
5. **Choice 4**: The shape doesn¡¯t align with the original structure on rotation.

The matching 3D structure is shown in **Choice 3**.
