To determine which of the choices shows the same object rotated in 3D, we need to carefully analyze the structure and orientation of the cubes.

1. **Original Image Shape Analysis**:
   - The shape resembles an "L" structure with a vertical segment and two perpendicular horizontal sections, forming a 3D right-angle.

2. **Choice 1**:
   - This shape has a longer vertical segment and aligns with the structure of the original image. This matches the configuration seen in the original in terms of cube lengths and angle.

3. **Choice 2**:
   - This shape seems to have a different configuration, with an extra segment on one end, deviating from the ¡°L¡± pattern of the original.

4. **Choice 3**:
   - Appears to be identical to the original structure in terms of cubes and orientation.

5. **Choice 4**:
   - This shape is twisted in a way that doesn¡¯t align with the original structure. It introduces an inconsistency in the angular arrangement of cubes.

After analyzing each option:
