To determine which of the choices is the same object rotated, let's analyze the configuration of the cuboids in the original image and compare them to each choice:

1. **Original Shape:** 
   - It consists of a zigzag pattern with blocks. 
   - There are three segments: the bottom segment with three cubes, the middle vertical segment with two cubes, and the top horizontal segment with three cubes.

2. **Choice 1:** 
   - The arrangement of the cubes does not match the original. The direction of the segments is different.

3. **Choice 2:** 
   - The shape is oriented vertically but maintains the same segment pattern as the original.

4. **Choice 3:** 
   - The cubes form a different direction, making it dissimilar to the original configuration.

5. **Choice 4:** 
   - The zigzag and segment lengths appear to match. The orientation is different, but it visually aligns with the structure of the original.

Considering the structure and rotations, the answer is Choice 4.
