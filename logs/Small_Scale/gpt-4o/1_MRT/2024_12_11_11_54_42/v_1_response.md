First, let's analyze the original shape:

- The original shape consists of two sections: 
  - A longer L-shaped section.
  - A shorter smaller section perpendicular to the L-shape.

Now, let's analyze each choice:

- **Choice 1**:
  - The shape appears as an S-figure rather than an L-shaped figure with a perpendicular addition.

- **Choice 2**:
  - The shape is another L-shaped structure, but it doesn't have an additional perpendicular part like in the original.

- **Choice 3**:
  - This shape is similar to the original. It includes an L-shape with a perpendicular short section matching the original shape's structure.

- **Choice 4**:
  - This is not a simple L-shape with a short perpendicular section but instead another kind of L-like structure.

Based on the above analysis, **Choice 3** is the correct three-dimensional rotated version of the original image.
