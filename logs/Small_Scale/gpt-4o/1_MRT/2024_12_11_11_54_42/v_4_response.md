To determine which image shows the same object rotated in 3D, we can analyze the structure of the original shape and compare it with the choices.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. **Original Shape**: The image contains a 3D shape composed of cubes. It resembles an L-like structure:
   - Base: 2 cubes long.
   - Upright: 3 cubes high.
   - Top extension: 2 cubes horizontally from the top.

Let's now compare each choice:

- **Choice 1**: This shape starts with a base of 3 cubes, then turns and has a horizontal extension of 2 cubes. The original shape has a base of 2 cubes, which this does not match.
  
- **Choice 2**: This also has variations in the structure that do not match the original.

- **Choice 3**: This matches the original shape:
  - Base: 2 cubes.
  - Upright: 3 cubes.
  - Top extension: 2 cubes horizontally.

- **Choice 4**: This starts with 2 cubes horizontally, then turns with 3 cubes vertically and continues as a shape that matches but is not oriented the same way as the original.

Therefore, Choice 3 depicts the same shape as the original, just rotated.
