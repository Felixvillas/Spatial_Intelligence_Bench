To determine which of the given choices represents the same three-dimensional shape as the original image, we can break down the shape into its components and analyze the rotations:

### Original Shape Analysis:
- The shape consists of a series of connected cubes.
- There is a vertical stack of 2 cubes on the top.
- To the bottom left, there's a horizontal stack of 3 cubes.
- In between, there is a connecting segment consisting of one single cube.

### Choices Analysis:

- **Choice 1**: The configuration matches the original, with the vertical stack on top and the horizontal section on the bottom left. This is the correct rotated version.

- **Choice 2**: The horizontal and vertical stacks are not oriented like the original image.

- **Choice 3**: The configuration does not match the original. The cubes are arranged differently.

- **Choice 4**: The angles and positioning do not correspond to the original shape configuration.

Based on this analysis, Choice 1 is the correct rotation of the original shape.
