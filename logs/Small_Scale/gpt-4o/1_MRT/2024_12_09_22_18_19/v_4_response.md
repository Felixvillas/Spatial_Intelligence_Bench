To determine which choice shows the same object rotated:

1. **Look at the original shape:** It's an L-shape made up of connected cubes, with a vertical and horizontal part, connected by a small bridge section.

2. **Analyze each choice:**

   - **Choice 1:** This shape has a disconnected piece and doesn't maintain the original structure.
   
   - **Choice 2:** This shape maintains the connected L-shape with a small bridge section but appears rotated differently. It matches the description.
   
   - **Choice 3:** This shape is consistent with the original structure but rotated.
   
   - **Choice 4:** The shape in this choice appears deformed and doesn't maintain the L-shape.

3. **Conclusion:** Choices 2 and 3 both maintain the structure through rotation, but the task is to identify the image that definitively matches as a rotational version of the original.

Therefore, the answer based on visible structure maintaining the integrity of alignment and connection as per the original description is:
