Let's analyze each image step by step:

1. **Identify the structure in the original image:**
   - The original shape consists of a sequence of cubes arranged in two perpendicular arms forming an "L" shape with an additional cube extending horizontally out of the corner.

2. **Compare with each choice:**
   - **Choice 1:** The shape is twisted but doesn't have the horizontal extension in the same position.
   - **Choice 2:** This shape is rotated, but the orientation of the cubes differs because there seems to be a twist not present in the original.
   - **Choice 3:** The configuration matches the original. The "L" shape with the single cube protruding matches the original structure.
   - **Choice 4:** The cubes form an "L" structure, but the arm orientations and junctions don't match.

**Analysis Conclusion:**
- The third choice is a rotated version of the original image.
