To determine which choice represents the same object as the original, but rotated, we need to compare the configurations:

1. **Original Shape:**
   - The shape consists of two segments: 
     - The horizontal segment has four cubes.
     - The vertical segment has three cubes extending from the end of the horizontal segment.
   - Another vertical segment of two cubes extends from the second-to-last cube in the horizontal segment.

2. **Choice 1:** 
   - Matches the original shape: 
     - It has a horizontal segment of four cubes.
     - It has a vertical segment of three cubes extending from the end of the horizontal segment.
     - Another vertical segment of two cubes extends from the second-to-last cube in the horizontal segment.

3. **Choice 2:**
   - The configuration of segments does not match the original. 

4. **Choice 3:**
   - The vertical segment does not extend from the end of the horizontal segment. 

5. **Choice 4:**
   - The configuration is different from the original.

After evaluating each choice, we can conclude that:

Choice 1 represents the same object as the original, but rotated.
