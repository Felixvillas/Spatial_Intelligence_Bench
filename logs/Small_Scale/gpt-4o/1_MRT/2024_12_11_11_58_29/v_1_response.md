Let's analyze the given shape:

The original shape has a particular configuration of cubes:

1. A longer section made of several linked cubes.
2. A shorter section extending perpendicular from the longer section.

Now, let's examine each choice to see if they can be the same shape rotated in 3D:

- **Choice 1**: This shape appears to have two sections of cubes that match the count and orientation when rotated, so it could be the same shape.

- **Choice 2**: The arrangement doesn't match; the sections are not connected in a way that could be a rotated version of the original.

- **Choice 3**: The arrangement seems to fit the pattern as the shape, when rotated appropriately.

- **Choice 4**: This shape has an arrangement where the cubes don't extend from the same position as in the original.

So, the correct matches are choices 1 and 3.
