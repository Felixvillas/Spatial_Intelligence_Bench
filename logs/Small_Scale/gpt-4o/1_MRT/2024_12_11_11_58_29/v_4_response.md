To solve this problem, we need to analyze the 3D shape given in the original image and compare it to each choice to see which one is a rotation of it.

1. **Original Image Analysis**:
   - The shape has a distinct "L" form consisting of four cube segments.
   - There are three segments forming the base of the "L" and one segment forming the vertical part.

2. **Choice Analysis**:
   - **Choice 1**: The shape has a horizontal piece similar to the original image, but the arrangement of cubes doesn't match the original shape.
   - **Choice 2**: This shape seems to have a different configuration where the cubes do not align to the original image's "L" structure.
   - **Choice 3**: This has the same configuration of cubes as the original image, just rotated.
   - **Choice 4**: The arrangement of the cubes forms a different orientation and does not match with the original shape.

The shape from the original image corresponds to Choice 3 when rotated.
