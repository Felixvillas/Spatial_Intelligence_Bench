To determine which figure is the same as the given shape but rotated, let's analyze the shape in the original image.

The shape consists of:
- A lower horizontal segment with 3 blocks (parallel to the bottom).
- An upper vertical segment with 3 blocks (pointing upward).
- A middle diagonal segment, connecting these two with 3 blocks.

Now, let's analyze each choice:

Choice 1:
- This image has a similar diagonal and vertical orientation as the original but does not clearly show the correct horizontal segment arrangement.

Choice 2:
- This image has a three-block horizontal section on the bottom and a three-block vertical section on the right, matching the original configuration after rotation.

Choice 3:
- This image displays a central diagonal block but reverses the position of other segments.

Choice 4:
- This image twists the shape such that the overall alignment doesn't match the original configuration.

Thus, choice 2 matches the original image but rotated.
