To determine which image shows the same object rotated in 3D, we need to compare the structure of the original shape with each choice:

1. **Original Shape Analysis:**
   - The shape consists of three connected sections, each made of several cubes.
   - It forms a zig-zag pattern with different orientations and cube counts.

2. **Choice Analysis:**
   - **Choice 1:** This shape has the same zig-zag pattern but appears to have different orientations and cube counts in the sections compared to the original.
   - **Choice 2:** This shape maintains the general structure and orientation, but the configuration and number of cubes in each section do not match the original.
   - **Choice 3:** This shape has a different configuration of cube sections and doesn't align with the original shape's arrangement.
   - **Choice 4:** This shape matches the original in terms of sections, orientation, and cube counts, showing a consistent zig-zag pattern that corresponds to a rotation of the original.

So, Choice 4 is the correct match.
