To solve this, let's visualize the layout:

1. **Grapes** - Starting point
2. **Donut** - Facing direction
3. **Book** - Destination to find the angle

Now, let's imagine the 2D plane as a flat map with the grapes as the origin (0, 0), facing the donut.

- **Step 1:** Determine the direction from grapes to the donut (facing direction).
- **Step 2:** Determine the direction from grapes to the book.
- **Step 3:** Calculate the angle difference between these two directions, using a clockwise convention as positive. If the angle is anti-clockwise, it will be negative.

Based on the image:

- From grapes to donut is roughly along the positive x-axis.
- From grapes to book is slightly to the right of the straight line, which indicates a small clockwise angle.

By visualization:

The book is slightly in the clockwise direction from your facing direction, so the angle must be small and positive, which corresponds closely to option 3) -57 degrees.
