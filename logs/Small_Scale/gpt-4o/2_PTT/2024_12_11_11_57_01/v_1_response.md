To find the angle of the apple relative to the bat (facing the book), let's analyze the positions:

1. The bat is at the origin of our reference point.
2. From the bat's perspective, the book is directly ahead.
3. The apple is to the left of the bat.

Now, determine the relative position:

- If you are facing the book from the bat's position, the apple is behind you and slightly to your left. This corresponds to a negative angular rotation.

Given the options, we deduce the angle:

- The option that represents the apple slightly to the left of directly behind the bat is -115 degrees (as it is further left compared to directly behind).

Therefore, the apple is at approximately -115 degrees relative to the bat.
