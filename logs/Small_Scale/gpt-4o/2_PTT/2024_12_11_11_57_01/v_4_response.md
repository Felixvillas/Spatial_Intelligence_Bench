To determine the angle at which the apple is located relative to you while facing the dog, we need to visualize the layout:

1. **Face the Dog**: The dog is directly in front, so that's 0 degrees.
2. **Position of the Apple**: From the images, the apple appears to be positioned to your left when facing the dog.
3. **Angle Determination**: Since the apple is to the left, this implies an anti-clockwise direction from your current direction.

Now, let's determine the closest from the provided options:
- **-85 degrees**: Slightly to the left but mostly forward.
- **-120 degrees**: Significantly to the left.
- **90 degrees**: To the right, which doesn't fit our scenario.
- **180 degrees**: Directly behind, which also doesn't fit.

Given the layout, -120 degrees is the most reasonable choice.
