To solve this, let's analyze the position of each object from your perspective standing at the grapes, facing the donut.

1. **Imagine you are at the grapes facing the donut:**
   - From the grapes (looking towards the donut), the donut is straight ahead.
   - The book is located above and to the right relative to the initial position and direction.

2. **Determining angles:**
   - From facing the donut straight ahead (0 degrees), turn your view until you face the book.
   - The book is positioned to the right, requiring a clockwise rotation.

3. **Estimating the angle:**
   - The book is not directly to the side (which would be ¡À90 degrees) but slightly less than that. Between 0 and -90 degrees, the closest estimate is slightly less than 45 degrees.
   - Among the given options, -37 is the closest and most reasonable estimation.
