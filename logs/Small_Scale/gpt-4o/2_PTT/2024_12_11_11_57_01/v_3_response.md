To determine the angle of the bat from the perspective of standing at the cake and facing the desk, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial direction:** 
   - At the starting position (cake), facing towards the desk means you're oriented towards the bottom of the image.

2. **Determine the relative position of the bat:**
   - The bat is located to the right and slightly upwards of your position at the cake.

3. **Estimate the angle:**
   - Since clockwise is positive and anti-clockwise is negative, a slightly clockwise direction is a small positive angle.

4. **Choose the closest option:**
   - From the available options, 21 degrees is a small clockwise angle that fits the bat's position relative to facing the desk.

Thus, the bat is located at approximately 21 degrees clockwise relative to facing the desk.
