To find the angle at which the grape is located relative to the fish:

1. Visualize yourself at the fish, facing the bat.
2. Note that moving towards the grapes would require a turn from facing the bat.
3. Observing the placement, the grapes appear to be below and to the right of the fish.
4. To turn from the fish (facing the bat) towards the grapes, which are located downwards-right:
   - A clockwise turn from your initial position.

The position aligns with a small clockwise angle, closest to the first option.
