To solve this, we'll analyze the relative positions of the objects:

1. You're standing at the chair, facing the dog. This means the positive direction is towards the dog.
2. The apple is located to the right of the chair if you're facing the dog.

Let's calculate its angle:

- The apple is directly to the right of the chair, which corresponds to a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

Thus, the correct angle is 90 degrees. The answer in JSON format is:
