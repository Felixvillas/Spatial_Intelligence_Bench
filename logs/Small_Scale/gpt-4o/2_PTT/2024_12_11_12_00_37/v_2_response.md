To determine the angle at which the book is located relative to the grapes, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the position:**
   - You are standing at the grapes and facing the donut directly in front, which we'll assume to be at 0 degrees.

2. **Determine the position of the book:**
   - Visually, the book is slightly to the right of the donut from the perspective of the grapes.

3. **Estimate the angle:**
   - Since the book is to the right of the donut, the rotation to face the book is clockwise.
   - Among the given options, a small clockwise rotation to the right corresponds to a positive angle less than 90 degrees. The choices provided are -17, -77, -57, -37. Since we're looking for a positive angle, it implies that the direction given (-57 degrees) should indeed be counter-clockwise moving towards positive since the problem is asking for position relative from grapes facing donut.

4. **Calculate the most likely angle:**
   - Visual check: the book is approximately -57 degrees when modeling this scenario on a 2D plane from the grape's point of view since the majority of angles lie on plane towards the right of the donut.

Thus, the angle is approximately -57 degrees (anti-clockwise), which aligns with the visual depiction that moving directly to the right from the donut leads to the book.
