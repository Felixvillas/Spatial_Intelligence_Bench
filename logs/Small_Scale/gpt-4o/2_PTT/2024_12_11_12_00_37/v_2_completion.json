The choices provided are -17, -77, -57, -37. Since we're looking for a positive angle, it implies that the direction given (-57 degrees) should indeed be counter-clockwise moving towards positive since the problem is asking for position relative from grapes facing donut.\\n\\n4. **Calculate the most likely angle:**\\n   - Visual check: the book is approximately -57 degrees when modeling this scenario on a 2D plane from the grape's point of view since the majority of angles lie on plane towards the right of the donut.\\n\\nThus, the angle is approximately -57 degrees (anti-clockwise), which aligns with the visual depiction that moving directly to the right from the donut leads to the book.\\n\\nHere is the JSON format answer:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 3\\n}\\n```\",\"refusal\":null,\"role\":\"assistant\",\"audio\":null,\"function_call\":null,\"tool_calls\":null}}],\"created\":1733889644,\"model\":\"gpt-4o-2024-08-06\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"service_tier\":null,\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_c7ca0ebaca\",\"usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":305,\"prompt_tokens\":402,\"total_tokens\":707,\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"accepted_prediction_tokens\":0,\"audio_tokens\":0,\"reasoning_tokens\":0,\"rejected_prediction_tokens\":0},\"prompt_tokens_details\":{\"audio_tokens\":0,\"cached_tokens\":0}}}"
