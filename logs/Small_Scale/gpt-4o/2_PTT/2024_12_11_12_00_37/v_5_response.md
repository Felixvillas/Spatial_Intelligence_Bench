To solve this, let's visualize the layout based on your position at the fish:

1. **Initial Orientation**: You are standing at the fish and facing the bat.
   - The bat is directly in front of you, so the direction you are facing is at 0 degrees.

2. **Position of Other Objects**:
   - The grapes are located above you and slightly to the right of your position.

3. **Determining the Angle**:
   - Since we are facing the bat directly, and the grapes are slightly to the right, we need to calculate the angle formed.
   - Comparing visually, the grapes appear to be more or less aligned diagonally upwards, which suggests that you rotate clockwise to face them.

If we assume the grape is slightly to the right at about a 45-degree angle clockwise, we round it to the nearest option available, which is closest to 47 degrees.
