To determine the angle at which the apple is located relative to the position of the bat (your starting point) when facing the book, follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Orientation:**
   - Standing at the bat and facing the book means you are looking straight to the top-right corner.
   - This direction is considered 0 degrees.

2. **Locate the Apple:**
   - The apple is positioned to the right of the bat, but slightly below.
   - Moving directly to the right from the bat would imply an angle of -90 degrees (clockwise).
   - Since the apple is slightly above the horizontal line but below 0 degrees (the line towards the book), we need a smaller angle than -90 but not smaller than 0.

3. **Approximate the Angle:**
   - To find the angle between your line of sight (0 degrees) and the direction to the apple, estimate how much you need to rotate from your current direction.
   - The apple is below the book but not as far down as a full -90 degree rotation.
   - Therefore, the rotation is slightly past the straight line to the right.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The apple is approximately -55 degrees from the line directly facing the book.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is option 4.
