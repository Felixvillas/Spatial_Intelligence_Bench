To determine the angle of the bat relative to the cake when facing the desk, follow these steps:

1. Visualize the scene as if you are standing at the cake and facing the desk directly.
2. Calculate the relative direction of each object:
   - You're facing straight towards the desk, which is at 0 degrees.
   - Locate the bat: It appears slightly to the right of your line of sight to the desk.
3. Measure the angle relative to your line of sight:
   - The bat is slightly clockwise from your line of sight to the desk.

From the given options, the angle closest to the right position is 21 degrees clockwise.

Therefore, the correct angle is option 2.
