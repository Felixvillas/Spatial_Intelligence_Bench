To solve this, we need to determine the angle from the grapes facing the donut to the book.

1. **Determine Current Direction:** You are facing the donut, which is located to the bottom-right relative to the grapes.

2. **Determine Location of Book:** The book is directly to the right relative to the grapes.

3. **Calculate the Angle:**
   - From the grapes, the donut is in the bottom-right quadrant.
   - The book is directly right, hence turning anti-clockwise to reach the book.
   - The angle measured anti-clockwise from facing directly bottom-right to directly right is 45 degrees.
   - Since directions are given clockwise as positive, anti-clockwise rotation is negative: -45 degrees.

4. **Choose the Closest Option:** The closest negative option to -45 degrees is -37 degrees.
