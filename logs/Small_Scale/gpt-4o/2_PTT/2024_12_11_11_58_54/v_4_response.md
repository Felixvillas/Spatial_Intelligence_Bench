To solve this problem, let's visualize the scenario:

1. **Current Position**: You are standing at the chair and facing the dog. This implies that the dog is directly in front of you at 0 degrees.

2. **Location of the Apple**: 
   - In the image, the apple is located to the lower right of the chair.

3. **Calculating the Angle**:
   - You are facing forward towards the dog (0 degrees).
   - The apple is on the right side, suggesting a clockwise rotation.

4. **Determine the Options**:
   - Given the options, the apple is located at approximately a 90-degree clockwise turn relative to the direction you are facing.

Thus, the apple is located at 90 degrees relative to your position.
