To solve this, let's visualize the setup:

1. You're standing at the bat looking towards the book. This establishes your forward direction.
2. The apple is to the right of the bat.

Let's determine the angle step-by-step:

- If facing the book (forward direction), to face the apple, you would need to turn to the right, clockwise.
- Given the options, the angle from the bat to the apple is about \(-55\) degrees (clockwise rotation).

The relative angle from the bat to the apple is approximately:

1) -35
2) -15
3) -115
4) -55

The correct answer is \(-55\).
