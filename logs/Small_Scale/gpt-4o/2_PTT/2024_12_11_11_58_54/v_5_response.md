To determine the angle, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Initial Direction:**
   - You are facing the bat.

2. **Locate the Grape:**
   - The grape is to your right and slightly downward from your current position.

3. **Determine the Angular Rotation:**
   - A clockwise rotation from your position facing the bat to face the grape would place the angle around 47 degrees.

Now select the option that matches this reasoning.
