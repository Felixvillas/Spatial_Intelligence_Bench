To find the angle of the bat relative to the cake when facing the desk:

1. **Position Setup:** 
   - You are at the cake, facing towards the desk.
   - The direction from the cake to the desk represents 0 degrees.

2. **Visualize Other Objects:** 
   - A clockwise rotation from the direct path to the desk is positive, and counterclockwise is negative.
   - From the cake, the bat is located slightly to the left of the line connecting the cake and the desk.

3. **Determine the Angle:** 
   - The bat is slightly to the left, implying a small negative angle (counterclockwise) when facing the desk.

4. **Conclusion:** 
   - Comparing all options, the correct angle for the bat is approximately -19 degrees.
