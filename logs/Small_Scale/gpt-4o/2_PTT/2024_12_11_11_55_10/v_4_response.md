To solve this, let's visualize the scenario step by step:

1. **Positioning**:
   - You're standing at the chair.
   - You're facing the dog.

2. **Relative Positions**:
   - The chair is in the center of the image.
   - The dog is directly to your left when you face it from the chair.

3. **Apple Location**:
   - The apple is below the chair in the image.

4. **Angle Calculation**:
   - From the chair, directly facing the dog is 0 degrees.
   - The apple being below means it's directly downward, which is a 90-degree turn clockwise from facing the dog.

Therefore, the apple is located at an angle of 90 degrees.
