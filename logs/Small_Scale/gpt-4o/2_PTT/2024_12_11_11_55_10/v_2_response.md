Sure! Let's analyze the image step-by-step based on your position:

1. **Initial Position:** You are standing at the grapes and facing the donut. This direction is considered 0 degrees.
2. **Turn Clockwise:**
   - If you turn towards the right from your position, you are moving in a clockwise direction.
   - The book is located to the right side relative to your starting direction.
3. **Estimate the Angle:**
   - From the grapes, the donut is straight ahead (0 degrees).
   - The book is at an angle slightly below the donut, suggesting a small clockwise rotation from your viewpoint.
   
Given the options and visual approximation:
- The book appears to be around 17 degrees clockwise from the donut.

So, the book is located approximately at -17 degrees (as clockwise rotations are positive).
