To solve this, let's visualize the scenario:

1. **Objects Placement:**
   - Bat: Reference point or your viewpoint.
   - Book: Directly in front, ahead in a straight line.
   - Apple: Located slightly to the left of the direct line to the book.

2. **Visualizing the Angle:**
   - From the bat's position, facing towards the book, the apple is positioned to the left.
   - The angle between facing forward and to the left is negative (anticlockwise).
   - Among the options, the most appropriate anticlockwise angle with a moderate left deviation is -35 degrees.

Thus, the angle of the apple relative to the line of sight from the bat to the book is:
