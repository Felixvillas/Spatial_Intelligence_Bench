To solve the problem, let¡¯s break down the position of each object relative to you standing at the cake and facing the desk:

1. **Position yourself at the cake**: Assume this point as (0,0) for reference.
2. **Face the desk**: The desk is in the direction you are facing.

3. **Determine the angle to the bat:**
   - The bat is located slightly to the right and above the desk position, indicating a small clockwise angle from your direct line of sight to the desk.

Now, let¡¯s check the options:
- **1) -19**: This is a small counter-clockwise rotation, likely incorrect because the bat is to the right.
- **2) 21**: This indicates a small clockwise rotation, which seems most accurate based on the bat's position.
- **3) 1**: This is nearly no rotation; the bat is further to the right.
- **4) -39**: A larger counter-clockwise rotation; again, not in line with the bat¡¯s position.

Given that the bat is more towards the right from the straight line to the desk, **21** appears to be the correct clockwise angle.
