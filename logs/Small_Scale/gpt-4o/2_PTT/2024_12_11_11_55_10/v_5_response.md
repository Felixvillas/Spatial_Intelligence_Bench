To determine the angle of the grape relative to the fish:

1. **Starting point:** Imagine standing at the fish, facing the bat directly. 

2. **Direction vector:** The bat is generally upward and slightly to the right relative to the fish.

3. **Grape's position:** The grape is directly to the right of the fish.

4. **Angle determination:** 
   - Facing forward (towards the bat) is considered 0 degrees.
   - Turning to the right (clockwise) by 90 degrees will point directly at the grape.

Thus, the grape is at an angle of 90 degrees.
