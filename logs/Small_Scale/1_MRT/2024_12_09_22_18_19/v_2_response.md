To determine which choice shows the same three-dimensional shape:

1. **Original Shape Analysis:**
   - The original shape is composed of several cubes that form a specific zig-zag pattern. 
   - The pattern includes two bends. The layout can be categorized as one part going up, then horizontally, ending with a vertical rise.

2. **Choice Analysis:**

   - **Choice 1:** This shape has two bends, but the arrangement does not match the pattern of the original image.
   - **Choice 2:** The shape orientation suggests vertical stacking, not matching the bends in the original image.
   - **Choice 3:** The layout of cubes forms a similar zig-zag pattern with two bends matching the original's pattern.
   - **Choice 4:** This choice presents a different alignment of cubes, which does not reflect the stacking pattern seen in the original image.

Thus, the correct match for the original shape in a rotated form is:
