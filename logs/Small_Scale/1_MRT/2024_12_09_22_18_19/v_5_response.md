To solve this problem, let¡¯s analyze the original shape and compare it with each choice:

1. **Original Image:** The shape is an L-shaped figure composed of five cubes on one plane and three cubes extending upward in the middle of the horizontal line.

2. **Choice 1:** Matches the original shape when rotated because it has five cubes on one plane with three cubes extending vertically from the third cube of the horizontal line.

3. **Choice 2:** The configuration does not match the original shape in its structure; the cubes extend differently.

4. **Choice 3:** Matches the original shape. Five cubes form a plane with three cubes extending vertically from the joint area, similar to the original structure.

5. **Choice 4:** The cubes do not align structurally with the original shape.

Choice 3 matches the original shape when rotated.
