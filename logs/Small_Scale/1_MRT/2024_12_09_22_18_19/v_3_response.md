To solve this, let's examine the shape in the original image and compare it to the choices:

1. **Original Shape Features:**
   - It has a distinctive L-shape with one side longer than the other.
   - In the image, the shape has a thin segment that leads into a wider segment.

2. **Choice 1:**
   - The shape is similar with an L-shape but looks like it has no change in the wide segment. It seems more like a straight line with uniform width.

3. **Choice 2:**
   - This shape is rotated but maintains the original L-shape proportions and segments comparable to the original image.

4. **Choice 3:**
   - The shape is similar to an upside-down L-shape, but it maintains the proportions of the original.

5. **Choice 4:**
   - The shape looks different and doesn¡¯t resemble the original shape¡¯s proportions as well.

The best match is **Choice 3**.
