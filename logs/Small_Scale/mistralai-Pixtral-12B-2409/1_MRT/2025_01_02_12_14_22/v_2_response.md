The image shows a 3D object composed of cubes in a unique arrangement. The object appears to have multiple twists and turns.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:
1. The object in the reference image starts with a vertical sequence of cubes on the left.
2. The arrangement then twists upwards at an angle.
3. The cubes continue horizontally before twisting downwards again.

Upon examining each choice:
- **Choice 1**: Shows a different orientation with the side structure appearing more to the front.
- **Choice 2**: Demonstrates a similar twist pattern but with the left side more prominently displayed.
- **Choice 3**: Displays an orientation where the horizontal section is more visible, differing from the reference image.
- **Choice 4**: Appears most similar to the reference image, with the same left-to-right and upward transitions.

Thus, the correct choice is:
