To determine which image shows the same object rotated in 3D, we need to carefully observe the structure and relative positions of the cubes in each choice.

1. **Choice 1:**
   - This image shows a structure that bends at an angle, turning first left and then right. The alignment of the cubes is in a continuous sequence.

2. **Choice 2:**
   - This image shows a similar structure with an angular bend. However, the positioning of the cubes looks altered, making it less familiar compared to the original shape.

3. **Choice 3:**
   - This image has a larger angular bend with the cubes seemingly connected in a linear fashion.

4. **Choice 4:**
   - This image shows a structure that extends vertically before bending. There is a change in alignment before it continues.

Upon comparing these choices with the original image, it appears that **Choice 1** has the same sequence of cubes aligning and bending in the same manner as the original image.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
