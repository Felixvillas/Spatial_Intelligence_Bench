The structure appears twisted rather than making a simple 90-degree turn.\\n- **Choice 2**: This image features a vertical arrangement of cubes, turning 90 degrees horizontally midway. This resembles the original image's structure closely.\\n- **Choice 3**: This looks more like an L-shape, with a vertical stack of cubes followed by a horizontal stack.\\n- **Choice 4**: These cubes are arranged curve-like, different from the straight lines and 90-degree turn of the original image.\\n\\nBased on this comparison, Choice 2 closely matches the original image in its orientation and shape complexities.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 2\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": []\n            },\n            \"stop_reason\": null\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1735791286,\n    \"model\": \"/lustre/S/tianzikang/LLMs/mistralai-Pixtral-12B-2409/mistralai-Pixtral-12B-2409/\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": null,\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 217,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 884,\n        \"total_tokens\": 1101,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": null,\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": null\n    },\n    \"prompt_logprobs\": null\n}"
