To determine which image shows the same object as the original, rotated in 3D, we need to compare the shapes and orientations.

The original image consists of a long, linear arrangement of cubes, taking a 90-degree turn before continuing linearly for a short distance.

Now, let's analyze each choice:

- **Choice 1**: This image shows a slightly different arrangement of cubes. The structure appears twisted rather than making a simple 90-degree turn.
- **Choice 2**: This image features a vertical arrangement of cubes, turning 90 degrees horizontally midway. This resembles the original image's structure closely.
- **Choice 3**: This looks more like an L-shape, with a vertical stack of cubes followed by a horizontal stack.
- **Choice 4**: These cubes are arranged curve-like, different from the straight lines and 90-degree turn of the original image.

Based on this comparison, Choice 2 closely matches the original image in its orientation and shape complexities.
