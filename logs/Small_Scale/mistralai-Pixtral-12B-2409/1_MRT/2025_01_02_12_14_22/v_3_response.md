To determine which image shows the same object as the original image but rotated in 3D, we need to compare the configurations, shapes, and alignment of the cubes.

1. **Choice 1**: This image shows a different configuration where the blocks are arranged in a straight needle-like structure, bent at 90 degrees, not matching the original.

2. **Choice 2**: This image has a similar block configuration with a different orientation, possibly more aligned to the original's 3D structure but slightly altered.

3. **Choice 3**: This image shows a Z-shape with more complex angles, not matching the simpler structure of the original.

4. **Choice 4**: This image shows a leftward bending shape with flat orientations that do not match the complexity or angles of the original.

Considering these comparisons, the closest match to the original is **Choice 2**.
