To find the correct reference line pair that matches the angle between the two lines in the first image, we need to observe and estimate the angle visually and compare it to the spread of lines in the legend:

1. The lines in the first image diverge less sharply, indicating a narrower angle.
2. In the legend, we aim to find similar convergence between the lines:
- Lines 1 and 9: Create a wide angle, possibly close to 180 degrees, which is too broad.
- Lines 1 and 7: Still quite wide, visually closer to around 135 degrees, which seems excessive compared to the original image.
- Lines 1 and 3: The convergence is quite tight, suggesting a much narrower angle, likely too narrow compared to the two lines in the image.
- Lines 1 and 6: Visually, this pair provides a moderate angle that might correspond to the one in the image more closely than the others.

Given these observations, option 4 (Lines 1 and 6) appears to be the closest match in terms of angles based on visual estimation.
