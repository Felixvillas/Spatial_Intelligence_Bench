The angle between the two original lines in the provided image appears to be acute, greater than a right angle but significantly lesser than 180 degrees. To determine which pair of reference lines best matches this angle, we should estimate it visually relative to the angles demonstrated on the reference legend.

- Lines 1 and 4 appear to create an angle around 90 degrees (a right angle), which seems too wide.
- Lines 1 and 3 form an angle that is less than 90 degrees, slightly more acute than the angle created by lines 1 and 4.
- Lines 1 and 2 are very close together, making the angle between them quite small in comparison to what is visible in the original image.
- Lines 1 and 8 form a much wider angle, distinctly larger than any of the others mentioned and essentially covers a major portion of the half-circle depicted.

From these observations, we can estimate that the angle between lines 1 and 3 most closely resembles the angle between the two original lines in the image.

Using the provided options:
1. Lines 1 and 4 每 Too wide.
2. Lines 1 and 3 每 Best match.
3. Lines 1 and 2 每 Too narrow.
4. Lines 1 and 8 每 Far too wide.

Thus, the answer will be:
