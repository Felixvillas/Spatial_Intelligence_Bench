From the first image provided, the angle between the two lines can be visually estimated by comparing it to the reference angles shown in the second image.

- Comparing the options:
  1) Lines 1 and 8 seem to form a larger angle.
  2) Lines 1 and 7 form an angle that is slightly wider but still large.
  3) Lines 1 and 11 would indicate almost a straight line, which is not visually observed in the first image.
  4) Lines 1 and 4 appear to form a narrower angle.

From my visual analysis, the angle between the two lines in the first image is subtler and roundly corresponds to the angle between lines numbered 1 and 4 in the second image. Thus, the closest matching pair in terms of angle seems to be:
