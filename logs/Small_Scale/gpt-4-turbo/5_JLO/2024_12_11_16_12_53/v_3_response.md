From observing the first image with the two lines, I will estimate the angle between the lines. Then, comparing this position with the angles shown in the reference lines from the legend (second image), I will determine the closest matching pair from the provided choices.

In the first image, the angle between the two lines seems approximately right or slightly larger, but definitely less than 180 degrees. Comparing this with the second image:
- Lines 1 and 9 are approximately 180 degrees apart, which is too wide.
- Lines 1 and 7 are narrower, possibly around 120 to 150 degrees, which could be close.
- Lines 1 and 3 would be far too narrow, possibly around 30 to 60 degrees.
- Lines 1 and 6 look to be about 90 degrees, potentially fitting better than others given the first image's setup.

Estimating by visual matching when compared to the legend, the closest and most reasonable match appears to be where those in the first image approximate an angle similar to that between lines 1 and 6 in the legend. 

Thus, my answer in JSON format is:
