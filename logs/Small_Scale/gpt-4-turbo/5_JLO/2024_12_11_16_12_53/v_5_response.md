First, observe the original image you provided, which contains two lines. From the appearance, one line is vertical while the other is tilted to the right but less than a horizontal position.

Next, compare the angle formed by these two lines with the reference lines in the second image. The reference line labeled "1" is horizontal. The lines spread out from there in increasing angles moving anticlockwise.

Given the angle between the original lines:
- Line 1, which is horizontal, would serve as a base reference.
- Analyzing the angle in the original lines, the vertical line corresponds to a turn from the horizontal approaching 90 degrees, but the tilted line doesn't quite reach 45 degrees (which could have been between lines 6 and 7).

Based on this observation, the closest matches are:
- Line 1 and Line 3. Line 3 is distinctly less than 45 degrees away from the horizontal, matching the angle indicated by the original tilted line.

Thus, the correct answer by matching the lines from the legend image is:
