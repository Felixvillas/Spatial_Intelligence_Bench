In the first image with two lines, one line is vertical and the other line is slanted to the right, forming an angle less than 90 degrees with the vertical line, potentially between 45 and 90 degrees. 

Now, analyzing the second image with numbered reference lines:
- Lines 1 and 7 form an angle of 180 degrees as they are directly opposite each other.
- Lines 1 and 3 involve one vertical and one inclined line to the right, suggesting an angle under 90 degrees.
- Lines 1 and 2 form a smaller angle, closer to 0 and under 45 degrees.
- Lines 1 and 11 also result in an angle of 180 degrees as both lines are horizontal and directly opposite each other.

Based on the visual inspection and alignment with angles less than 90 degrees, line pair 1 and 3 appears closest to the angle represented in the first image.
