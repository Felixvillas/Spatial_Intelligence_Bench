To determine which reference line pair matches the angle between the original lines in the image, I visually analyze the distribution of the angles in the legend and compare it to the lines in the image.

- In the image, the two lines form an angle; the angle seems to be an acute angle (less than 90 degrees).
- Comparing that angle to the lines in the legend:
  - Looking at Lines 1 and 3 in the legend, these lines form a small angle that is still quite visible and slightly wider than what would be considered minimal.
  - The pairs associated with Lines 1 and 9 or Lines 1 and 6 would form a much larger angle (reflecting obtuse observations).
  - Line 1 and 7 appears to form an angle still larger than what is observed in the image.

Based on the visual comparison, Lines 1 and 3 from the legend seem to closely represent the angle seen in the image between the two lines.
