From observing the two images provided:

1. The image with the angle between two lines shows that the angle appears relatively narrow.
2. Comparing this with the reference lines image:
   - Lines 1 and 9 form a very wide angle.
   - Lines 1 and 7 form an moderately wide angle.
   - Lines 1 and 6 form a moderately narrow angle.
   - Lines 1 and 3 form a narrow angle.

Based on the narrowness of the angle, the pair that likely matches the angle shown in the first image is the pair consisting of Lines 1 and 3.
