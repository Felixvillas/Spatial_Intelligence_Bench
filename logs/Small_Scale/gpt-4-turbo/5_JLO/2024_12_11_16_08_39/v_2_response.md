Considering the images provided, the task is to estimate the angle between two lines in the first image using the angles shown in the reference image (schematic representation of lines numbered 1 through 11). The basic method is to mentally extrapolate where each of the two lines would fit within the fan of reference lines based on their inclinations.

- In the first image, the left line slightly angles up from the horizontal, while the right line also has a mild upward slope.
- Comparing this arrangement with the reference line image, if we consider line 1 as the horizontal baseline:
  - The left line in the first image appears to align approximately with line 7 or close to it on the reference image.
  - The right line doesn't incline steeply but is clearly right of line 6 and left of line 8.

Considering that the choices are structured around which reference lines encompass the angle created by the two lines, we can narrow down our choices. 

Choice analysis:
1) Lines 1 and 8 - This encompasses a larger angle than depicted by the two lines in the first image. 
2) Lines 1 and 7 - This seems to accurately reflect the orientation and inclination difference between the two lines based on the first image.
3) Lines 1 and 11 - This would result in too wide an angle.
4) Lines 1 and 4 - This describes a narrower angle than what is shown between the two lines.

Based on this analysis, the best match is provided by Choice 2, which suggests that the angle between lines 1 and 7 matches the angle between the two lines in the first image.
