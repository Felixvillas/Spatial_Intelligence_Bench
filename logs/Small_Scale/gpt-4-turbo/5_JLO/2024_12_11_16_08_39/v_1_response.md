Analyzing the first provided image, we observe two lines situated within a square, appearing to intersect at an acute angle. The lines are neither horizontal nor vertical but are angled slightly upwards and downwards.

To determine which reference line pairs from the second image best match the angle between the original lines, we compare with angles formed by lines emanating from a central point in the legend.

Consider the following from the legend:
- Lines 1 and 4 would create an angle that seems very close to a right angle, around 90бу.
- Lines 1 and 3 make an angle that is smaller but perhaps still larger than what we see in the original image.
- Lines 1 and 2 form an even smaller angle, and this might be closer to the acute angle noted in the first image.
- Lines 1 and 8 create a much larger angle, nearly opposite directions.

From the visual inspection, the acute angle in the original image seems closest to the smaller angles depicted in the reference image. Comparing the acuteness and positioning, Lines 1 and 2 from the legend appear to create an angle that most closely resembles the angle between the lines in the first image.

Thus, our answer is:
