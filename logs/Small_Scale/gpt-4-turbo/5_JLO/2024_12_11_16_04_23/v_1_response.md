To determine which pair of reference lines matches the angle between the two lines shown in the first image, I need to make a visual comparison based on the estimated direction and spread of those lines against the reference system described.

1. **Reference image analysis:**
   - Lines in the reference image are fanning out from a central point, and each line is spread evenly.
   - Given that there are 11 lines, we can reasonably guess that each line could represent an angle of approximately \(360 / (11-1) = 36^\circ\) between adjacent lines, with Line 1 being along the horizontal.

2. **Analyzing the lines in the provided image:**
   - Observe the directions of the two lines relative to a presumable horizontal base. The two lines are not drastically angled apart and seem relatively close together.

3. **Matching to reference lines:**
   - **Lines 1 and 4**: Considering each line represents an increment of 36 degrees, Lines 1 and 4 being apart would suggest an angle of \(36^\circ \times 3 = 108^\circ\).
   - **Lines 1 and 3**: This pairing would imply \(36^\circ \times 2 = 72^\circ\).
   - **Lines 1 and 2**: This suggests an angle of about 36 degrees between them, matching a smaller angle between the two lines in the initial image.
   - **Lines 1 and 8**: This configuration would mean \(36^\circ \times 7 = 252^\circ\), which is too wide.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - From visual estimation, the relative closeness of the two lines in the first image suggests they are not spread widely apart. An angle of \(36^\circ\) seems the most plausible among the provided options.
