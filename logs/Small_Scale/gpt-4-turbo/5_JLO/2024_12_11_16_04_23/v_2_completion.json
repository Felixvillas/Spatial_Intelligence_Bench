This suggests that the angle could be within a range that is slightly less than half of 180 degrees, probably around 40-60 degrees.\\n\\n2. **Analyzing the reference lines in the legend**:\\n    - **Lines 1 and 8**: This pair, assuming line 6 to be close to the vertical, would imply a near-180-degree angle subtended by them, which is far greater than the angle observed.\\n    - **Lines 1 and 7**: Lines 1 and 7 appear to have a less drastic angle than lines 1 and 8 but still wider than what the first image suggests.\\n    - **Lines 1 and 11**: This pair would subtend close to, or exactly, 180 degrees as they seem almost opposite to each other.\\n    - **Lines 1 and 4**: Given that the reference lines spread out symmetrically and presuming that each subsequent line represents a consistent angular increment, lines 1 and 4 seem to subtend a more moderate angle. Calculating with an assumption of evenly spaced increments, the angle between lines 1 and 4 appears to match visually with the original image.\\n\\nFrom these observations and assumptions:\\n- Angle between lines 1 and 4 in the reference appears most closely to match the angle observed between the two lines in the presented image. \\n\\nThus, the estimation can be formed into a json format:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 4\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733904280,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 358,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 653,\n        \"total_tokens\": 1011,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
