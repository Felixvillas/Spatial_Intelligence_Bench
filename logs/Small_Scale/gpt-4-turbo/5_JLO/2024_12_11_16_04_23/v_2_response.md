To determine the correct pair of reference lines that match the angle between the original lines shown in the image, let¡¯s break down the process:

1. **Visually estimating the angle between the two lines in the first image**: The lines appear to have a moderate angle between them but are not too wide apart. This suggests that the angle could be within a range that is slightly less than half of 180 degrees, probably around 40-60 degrees.

2. **Analyzing the reference lines in the legend**:
    - **Lines 1 and 8**: This pair, assuming line 6 to be close to the vertical, would imply a near-180-degree angle subtended by them, which is far greater than the angle observed.
    - **Lines 1 and 7**: Lines 1 and 7 appear to have a less drastic angle than lines 1 and 8 but still wider than what the first image suggests.
    - **Lines 1 and 11**: This pair would subtend close to, or exactly, 180 degrees as they seem almost opposite to each other.
    - **Lines 1 and 4**: Given that the reference lines spread out symmetrically and presuming that each subsequent line represents a consistent angular increment, lines 1 and 4 seem to subtend a more moderate angle. Calculating with an assumption of evenly spaced increments, the angle between lines 1 and 4 appears to match visually with the original image.

From these observations and assumptions:
- Angle between lines 1 and 4 in the reference appears most closely to match the angle observed between the two lines in the presented image. 

Thus, the estimation can be formed into a json format:
