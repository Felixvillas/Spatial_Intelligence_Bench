To determine which pair of reference lines match the angle between the two lines in the original image, we first observe the general direction and inclination of the two lines.

1. The first line in the image slants up and slightly to the left from a vertical center.
2. The second line slants up, but is more vertical than the first, somewhat to the right.

From the reference legend:
- Line 1 is horizontal.
- Angle widens as the line numbers increase.

Now, we visually compare the configuration in the first image with the reference angles:

1) Lines 1 and 9 create an angle that seems significantly wide. It looks too large compared to the angle between the lines in the image.
2) Lines 1 and 7 seem closer but still may be a bit wide.
3) Lines 1 and 3 create a much narrower angle, which does not correspond to the one in the image.
4) Lines 1 and 6 create an angle that appears to provide a good match in terms of visual comparison. The angle spread between these two reference lines looks quite similar to that between the two lines in the original image.

Considering the angles:
- Lines 1 and 3 correspond to a smaller angle as they are closer to being aligned vertically.
- Lines 1 and 7 provide a larger angle than what is seen in the first image.
- Lines 1 and 6 offer a moderately wide angle that fits visually between 1 and 7.

Thus, the correct answer, based on visual approximation and the logical deduction of angle sizes between reference lines, is:
