From the initial image, we need to determine the angle between the two lines by visually estimating their position relative to a reference point and finding a similar example in the provided legend.

Looking at the first image, the two lines are spread apart, forming an angle that's less than 180 degrees but significantly large.

In the legend:
- Line 1 is at 0 degrees.
- Line 3 appears to be placed at approximately 60 degrees.
- Line 6 is at 90 degrees (perpendicular).
- Line 7 is at approximately 120 degrees.
- Line 9 is at approximately 150 degrees.

Given the visual approximation, the angle between the lines in the first image looks to be roughly between Line 1 and 7, as these represent the lines at approximately 0 degrees and 120 degrees respectively. This matches the general shape and direction of the lines in the original image.

Thus, the correct answer in the presented format would be:
