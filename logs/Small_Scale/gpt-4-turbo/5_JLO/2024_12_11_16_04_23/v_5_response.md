In the provided image of the two lines, one is vertical while the other appears to slant toward the right from this vertical line. This configuration suggests an acute angle, narrower than 90 degrees. 

Looking at the legend, the pairs of lines numbered from 1 to 11 are used for reference:
- Lines 1 and 7 would create an angle close to 90 degrees.
- Lines 1 and 3 create an angle smaller than that between Lines 1 and 7, but larger than 45 degrees.
- Lines 1 and 2 form an even smaller angle, less than the angle between Lines 1 and 3.
- Lines 1 and 11 represent a complete horizontal orientation, creating a vastly different angle.

Considering these descriptions and comparisons, the appearance of the two lines in the given image corresponds most closely with the angle between Lines 1 and 3, which is a narrow acute angle, an estimate just under 90 degrees but clearly more than 45 degrees.
