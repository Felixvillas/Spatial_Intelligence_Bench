To find the angle between the two lines in the first image, you should visually compare that angle with the angles formed between the different pairs of reference lines provided in the second image. The pairs from the second image and their apparent angles relative to line 1 (considered as the 0 degrees line) are as follows:

- Lines 1 and 9: This forms the widest visible angle among the options, roughly aligning with 180 degrees.
- Lines 1 and 7: This pair forms an angle that appears less than that between Lines 1 and 9, but still quite wide, roughly estimating near 140 degrees.
- Lines 1 and 3: This pair would form a relatively sharp angle, possibly around 40-60 degrees.
- Lines 1 and 6: This pair forms an angle, from line 1 to line 6, which appears to be roughly around 90 degrees.

From a visual approximation based on the provided legend image and comparing it with the angles of lines in the first image, we can see the angle between the two lines is most similar to the angle formed between reference lines 1 and 3, which is a smaller, acute angle. Therefore, the closest answer is:
