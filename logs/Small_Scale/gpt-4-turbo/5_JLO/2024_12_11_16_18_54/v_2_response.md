From the first image, the two lines appear to make an acute angle that is slightly less than 90 degrees. Looking at the reference lines in the second image, we need to find two lines that match this configuration.

1) Lines 1 and 8 create an angle that seems more than 90 degrees, judging by their positions relative to the center.
2) Lines 1 and 7 also appear to create an angle that is clearly more than 90 degrees.
3) Lines 1 and 11 create an angle close to 180 degrees.
4) Lines 1 and 4 create an angle that is wider than a right angle but smaller than the angle between lines 1 and 8 or 1 and 7, yet the angle observed in the first image is narrower. 

None of these options perfectly matches the acute angle less than 90 degrees as seen in the first image between the two lines. However, the question does not provide an option that precisely matches the observed angle. Notably, the angles in options 1, 2, and 3 exceed 90 degrees, while the angle in option 4 is narrower than 90 degrees but still significantly more than the acute angle observed. 

If compelled to choose from these options under the assumption that an error exists in matching based on the available choices, I would pick the closest possible though not entirely matching option:
