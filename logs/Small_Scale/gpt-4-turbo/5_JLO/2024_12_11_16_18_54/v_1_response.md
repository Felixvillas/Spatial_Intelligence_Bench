To determine the angle between the two lines in the first image, we need to compare it closely to the angles formed by the reference line pairs in the second image (legend).

1. The lines in the first image form an acute angle, meaning the angle is less than 90 degrees.
2. Looking at the reference image:
   - Lines 1 and 4 are spread widely apart, clearly forming an angle significantly larger than that in the first image.
   - Lines 1 and 3 show a smaller angle than Lines 1 and 4, but it still seems too wide compared to the first image.
   - Lines 1 and 2 form an even narrower angle and appear to match the general orientation and size of the angle between the two lines in the first image.
   - Lines 1 and 8 create an angle that is far wider, approaching about 45 degrees which is visibly larger than the angle in the first image.

From these observations, the pair that best matches the angle in the first image is Lines 1 and 2.
