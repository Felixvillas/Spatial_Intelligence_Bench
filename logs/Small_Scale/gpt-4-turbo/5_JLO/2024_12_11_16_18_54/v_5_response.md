In the given geometry of the two lines from the original image, one line is vertically oriented and the other slants to the right. Without exact measurements, we can assess based on an apparent acute angle formed between them. 

Now, looking at the reference lines in the legend:
- Line 1 is horizontal.
- Line 3 is slightly tilted up from the horizontal.

If we estimate the position of the lines from the original image to a typical 2D Cartesian coordinate system where line 1 (from the legend) represents the horizontal x-axis, the vertical line in the original image could correspond closely with line 6 (directly vertical), and the slanted line could hover near line 3 or 4. Visually, the slant isn't steep, but it's more than just a slight nudge from vertical, which suggests it is closer to line 3 than line 4 or 2.

Given option:
1) Lines 1 and 7 - The angle between lines 1 and 7 in the legend is too wide.
2) Lines 1 and 3 - This option seems practical since the angle between line 1 and 3 in the legend approximately captures the acute angle seen in the original image between the horizontal and the right slanted line.
3) Lines 1 and 2 - The angle is too small to match the original lines.
4) Lines 1 and 11 - Line 11 swings too far; the angle is excessively large.

Thus, the most accurate pairing that represents the angle from the original lines would be:
