To determine which pair of reference lines best matches the angle between the two lines in the original image, we need to consider the visual appearance and direction of the lines shown in the legends for angle reference.

1. In the image of two lines, we notice that the lines are relatively closely adjacent rather than widely spread apart, thus suggesting a smaller angle.
2. Observing the provided legend:
   - Lines 1 and 8 form a relatively wide angle.
   - Lines 1 and 7, slightly narrower than lines 1 and 8.
   - Lines 1 and 11, significantly more spread indicating the largest angle.
   - Lines 1 and 4 form a relatively narrow angle.
  
From visual estimation, lines 1 and 4 in the legend reflect a closer adjacency and a smaller angle, which seems to match best with the two lines in the original image that are relatively closely positioned to each other.

Therefore, the most suitable option is:
