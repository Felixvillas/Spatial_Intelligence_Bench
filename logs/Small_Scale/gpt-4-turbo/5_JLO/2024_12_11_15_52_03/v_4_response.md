To determine the correct pair from the reference lines that match the angle between the two lines in the image provided, we begin by examining the distribution of angles in the legend:

1. Notice that line 1 is entirely horizontal.
2. The lines are uniformly distributed in a fan shape which we can assume map to regular intervals between them.

Assuming that each adjacent pair of lines in the reference legend increases the angle uniformly, and since there are 11 lines, 10 gaps split the 180 degrees semi-circle. Therefore, each gap represents an angle of \( 180 \div 10 = 18 \) degrees.

Let's examine each provided option:
- Lines 1 and 9: This covers 8 gaps with each gap at 18 degrees, resulting in an angle of \( 8 \times 18 = 144 \) degrees.
- Lines 1 and 7: This covers 6 gaps, so \( 6 \times 18 = 108 \) degrees.
- Lines 1 and 3: This covers 2 gaps, so \( 2 \times 18 = 36 \) degrees.
- Lines 1 and 6: This covers 5 gaps, so \( 5 \times 18 = 90 \) degrees.

Comparing these angles with the angle in the first image provided (the original lines), visually inspecting the lines indicates a sharp but not excessively wide angle, suggesting 36 degrees could be realistic, and thus Line 1 and Line 3 seem the most likely match. 

Thus, the answer should be:
