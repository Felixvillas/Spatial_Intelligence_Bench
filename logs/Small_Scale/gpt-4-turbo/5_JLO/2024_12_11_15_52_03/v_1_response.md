From the first image, visually inspecting the position and orientation of the two lines, we need a pair of reference lines that mimics the angle formed by these lines. 

Let's analyze the options given:

1. Lines 1 and 4: The angle seems to be too large compared to the one in the original image.
2. Lines 1 and 3: The angle between these reference lines appears wider than the one in the image but may be close; it's not the tightest option available.
3. Lines 1 and 2: This option offers a smaller angle, which seems to be a very tight fit, likely too narrow compared to the original image.
4. Lines 1 and 8: The angle here is significantly larger and does not match the image.

The best match among the given options judging purely visually appears to be between lines 1 and 3, taking into account a moderate angle that is neither too wide nor too narrow.
