To find the correct pair of reference lines that match the angle between the two lines in the first image, observe the relative orientation of the lines in each case:

1) In the original image, the two lines are slightly angled towards each other, creating an obtuse angle. This requires that we compare this configuration to the angles formed by the various pairs of lines from the reference image.

2) Based on visual analysis of the reference image:
   - Lines 1 and 9 create a wide, obtuse angle, almost nearing 180 degrees.
   - Lines 1 and 7 display an obtuse angle that is narrower than the one created by lines 1 and 9.
   - Lines 1 and 3 form an acute angle.
   - Lines 1 and 6 create a moderately obtuse angle, broader than lines 1 and 3 but narrower compared to lines 1 and 9.

3) By comparing the angles:
   - It's evident that lines 1 and 6 from the reference image relate closest to the angle between the two lines in the original image. Lines 1 and 6 create an obtuse angle similar in scale and orientation to the one in the picture with two lines.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
