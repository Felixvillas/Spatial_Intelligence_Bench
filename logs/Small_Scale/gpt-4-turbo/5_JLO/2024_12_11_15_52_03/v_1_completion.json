Lines 1 and 4: The angle seems to be too large compared to the one in the original image.\\n2. Lines 1 and 3: The angle between these reference lines appears wider than the one in the image but may be close; it's not the tightest option available.\\n3. Lines 1 and 2: This option offers a smaller angle, which seems to be a very tight fit, likely too narrow compared to the original image.\\n4. Lines 1 and 8: The angle here is significantly larger and does not match the image.\\n\\nThe best match among the given options judging purely visually appears to be between lines 1 and 3, taking into account a moderate angle that is neither too wide nor too narrow.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 2\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733903526,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 209,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 653,\n        \"total_tokens\": 862,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
