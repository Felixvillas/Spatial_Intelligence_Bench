Lines 1 and 7 would represent an angle that opens towards the left side of a vertical reference, which doesn't match the orientation in the original image.\\n2. Lines 1 and 3 form a narrow angle that opens to the right of the vertical line, which visually approximates the angle shown in the original image.\\n3. Lines 1 and 2 would describe an even narrower angle than lines 1 and 3.\\n4. Lines 1 and 11 depict a horizontal and a vertical line, creating a right angle, which is clearly much larger than the angle in the original image.\\n\\nBased on the visual comparison, the closest match in the original image is between lines described in option 2, as lines 1 and 3 provide a narrow angle to the right of the vertical similar to the angle in the original image.
