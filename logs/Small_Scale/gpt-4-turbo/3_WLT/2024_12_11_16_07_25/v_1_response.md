When the container is rotated, the water will adjust to maintain its level relative to gravity, with the surface of the water being horizontal. Thus, in the new orientation of the container, the water will still assume a horizontal level from the viewer's perspective.

Given the diagrams, Choice 4 most accurately demonstrates this behavior. The water level in Choice 4 is horizontal, which is consistent with how water behaves under the influence of gravity in a rotated container.
