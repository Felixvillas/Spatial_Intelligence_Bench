When the container is rotated, the water level remains parallel to the base due to gravity, which ensures that the free surface of water is always horizontal.

From the choices given:
- Choice 1 shows the water level aligned with one of the sides of the rotated container, which is incorrect.
- Choice 2 shows the water level correctly as horizontal, corresponding with how water retains its level relative to gravity.
- Choice 3 has the water again aligning incorrectly with the sides of the container.
- Choice 4 exhibits the same error as choice 1.

The correct representation of the water level in the rotated container is Choice 2 which shows a horizontal surface despite the container's tilted orientation.
