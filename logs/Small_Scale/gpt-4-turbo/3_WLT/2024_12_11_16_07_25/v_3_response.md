When the container is rotated, the water inside always seeks to maintain a level surface parallel to the ground due to gravity. Given that the container is initially upright and then rotated 45 degrees to form a diamond shape, the water will settle along the bottom edge of the container in its new orientation, again seeking to be level with the ground.

Given the four choices:
- Choice 1 shows water along one diagonal, which wouldn¡¯t be correct as this isn¡¯t how water would naturally settle due to gravity.
- Choice 2 also shows water along the other diagonal, and likewise, it isn¡¯t correct.
- Choice 3 displays water along one side of the diamond (rotated bottom), which is incorrect since it doesn't form a horizontal level with respect to gravity.
- Choice 4 shows water filling the bottom part of the rotated container and forming a level surface across the entire width of the bottom, parallel to the ground. This is what we would expect due to the effects of gravity. 

Therefore, the appropriate representation of the expected water level in the rotated container would be:
