When a container of water is rotated, the water inside will adjust according to the force of gravity, maintaining a level surface perpendicular to the direction of gravity. In the rotation scenario you provided, the surface of the water should remain horizontal relative to the ground, regardless of the container¡¯s tilt. 

Thus, when the container is rotated but still subjected to normal gravitational forces, the surface of the water inside the container will adjust to remain parallel to the ground.

Looking at the four choices provided:
- Choice 1 shows water slanting opposite to the angle of the container ¡ª incorrect because water does not adhere to the container's tilt.
- Choice 2 shows water forming a right angle with the container's left side, which implies gravity acting from a different angle ¡ª incorrect since gravity always pulls downwards.
- Choice 3 shows water parallel to the container top, which isn't realistic in normal conditions as it implies inadequate gravitational effect.
- Choice 4 shows water maintaining a horizontal level, which is accurate as this is how water would level itself under normal gravitational pull, regardless of the container's orientation.

Therefore, the correct choice is:
