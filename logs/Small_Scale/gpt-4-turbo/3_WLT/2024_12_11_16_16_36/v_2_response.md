When the container is rotated, the water inside would strive to maintain its level relative to gravity, meaning it will orient along a horizontal plane, regardless of the container's tilt. Examining the illustrations pertaining to the rotated container with water choices, it becomes clear that the image where the water level appears straight and horizontal (from the perspective of gravitational force) while the container is tilted corresponds to the correct representation of the physical situation due to rotation.

The only choice that reflects this reality, where the water level remains horizontal while the container tilts, is choice 2. Therefore, the correct answer in JSON format is:
