When the container is rotated, the water will still settle due to gravity, aligning itself to the new orientation of the container such that its surface becomes horizontal. Thus, the water will still adjust to be level horizontally within the container. Based on the choices presented:

- Choice 1 shows the water level at the bottom, as one would expect in an upright position but doesn't reflect the rotation.
- Choice 2 shows the water level diagonally, which incorrectly suggests water would distribute unevenly.
- Choice 3 shows the water level as if the container has not been rotated.
- Choice 4 shows the water level horizontally leveled in the rotated container, which matches the expected behavior of a fluid under gravity in a rotated capsule-like container.

Therefore, the correct choice based on the container's rotated position is:
