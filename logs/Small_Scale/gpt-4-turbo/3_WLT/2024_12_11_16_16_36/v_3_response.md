When the container is rotated, the water will also rotate, but it will always seek to maintain a horizontal level due to gravity. Thus, it will adjust its level to be perpendicular to the direction of gravity.

In the rotated square container, the water level should be parallel to the base of the container if it was positioned upright. Therefore, the new position of the water should be such that the surface of the water forms a straight horizontal line when the container is viewed in its new rotated position.

Comparing the choices given:

- Choice 1 shows a tilted water level, which is incorrect as the water would level itself out horizontally.
- Choice 2 shows a correct representation where the water is horizontal across the tilted container.
- Choice 3 shows a water level that is not adjusted for the rotation, thus incorrect.
- Choice 4 shows the water level in a horizontal position aligned with the top and bottom corners, which is incorrect.

Hence, the correct choice is:
