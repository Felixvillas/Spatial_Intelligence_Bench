When a container filled with water is rotated, the water remains level relative to the ground due to gravity. The correct depiction should show the surface of the water always being horizontal relative to the earth, no matter how the container is tilted.

In this case, all the choices show the water's surface at different angles, oriented relative to the sides of the rotated container, which is physically incorrect because the surface of a liquid at rest will always find a horizontal equilibrium due to gravity.

However, since we need to select the choice closest to this physical reality among the given options, we would choose the image where the water level appears most balanced and horizontal regardless of the container's orientation. Each depicted water level is influenced by the container's orientation, which is incorrect, but let's look for the least deviation from horizontal, assuming a slight perspective or visual error might be present.

Upon reviewing the images:
- Choice 1 shows the water level horizontal relative to the container¡¯s top edge, incorrect.
- Choice 2 shows the water level diagonal, matching the container's slope, incorrect.
- Choice 3 shows the water level diagonal, heavily aligned with the container's tilt, incorrect.
- Choice 4 shows the water level horizontal relative to the container's bottom edge, incorrect.

None of the choices show water level perfectly horizontal (as it should be in reality), but since Choice 3 shows the water level with a tilt that might be closest to a rotated view where the surface seems nearly horizontal (assuming a perspective or error), it seems to be the least incorrect.
