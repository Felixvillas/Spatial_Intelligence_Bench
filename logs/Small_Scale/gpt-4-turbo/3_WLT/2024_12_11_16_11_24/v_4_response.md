When you rotate a container filled with water, the water will remain horizontal due to gravity. The surface of the water always tries to align itself perpendicularly to the direction of gravity. Since the container is being rotated, the water inside will adjust and maintain its level horizontally relative to the ground.

**Observations for Each Choice:**
- Choice 1 and Choice 4 both depict the water maintaining a vertical alignment relative to the original position of the container, which would not be the case as the water shifts its alignment according to gravity to stay horizontal.
- Choice 2 shows the water level being diagonal, which suggests it is maintaining its orientation relative to the sides of the container, not gravity. This is incorrect.
- Choice 3 shows the water level horizontally aligned as it should be in response to gravity's pull, despite the container's diagonal orientation. This is the realistic depiction after the rotation.

Therefore, the expected appearance of the water level after rotating the container is accurately represented in:
