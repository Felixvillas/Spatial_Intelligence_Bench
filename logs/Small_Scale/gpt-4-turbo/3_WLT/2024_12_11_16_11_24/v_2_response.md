When the container is rotated, the water will seek its own level and align itself perpendicular to the direction of gravity. This means the surface of the water will always be horizontal relative to the ground, regardless of the angle of the container itself. The orientation of the container does not change the horizontal alignment of the water surface. 

Looking at the provided options:

- **Choice 1** shows water occupying the bottom edge of the tilted container, aligning along the diagonal slope. This is not realistic because the water level would need to defy gravity to conform to the container's tilt in this manner.
- **Choice 2** shows the water also tilted, aligning with the tilted bottom of the container. This, too, is incorrect as water cannot sustain an angled surface stable in a gravity field.
- **Choice 3** incorrectly shows water horizontally aligned but at a lower level on the container¡¯s wall, not filling up to the level it would realistically occupy given the amount in the original upright container.
- **Choice 4** shows the water horizontally level across the tilted container, filling it to a level consistent with its volume in the upright container. This is correct because irrespective of the container¡¯s angle, water forms a horizontal surface.

Thus, the correct choice that matches the expected water level in the rotated container based on the orientation and amount of water initially present is:
