When the container is rotated diagonally, the water level inside will continue to seek a horizontal level, due to the natural orientation of fluids under gravity which always find level irrespective of the container shape. The water will spread out along the new orientation to maintain this level. 

Given the choices presented:

- Choice 1 shows the water level that initially appears horizontal but considering the rotation, this would suggest the water is not obeying gravity.
  
- Choice 2 shows the water sloped, which again defies the behavior of fluids in a static condition because the water should level out horizontally.

- Choice 3 shows the water level at the bottom only along one side, which does not accord with how water distributes evenly across the available horizontal space at the lowest level.

- Choice 4 shows a consistent, flat water level across the bottom of the rotated container, reflecting how water remains level relative to gravity.

Thus, the correct representation of water level after rotation is given by:
