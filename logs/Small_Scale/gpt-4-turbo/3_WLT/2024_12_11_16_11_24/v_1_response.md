When the container is rotated to have the neck pointing to the side, the water inside the container will also shift due to gravity. The water will settle so that its surface is horizontal. Therefore, the level of the water should become horizontal across the widest dimension of the container, which means the water level should not be slanted or biased towards the neck.

From the provided choices:

- Choice 1 shows the water level at the bottom, which would not be accurate after rotation as the water will distribute more towards the center due to the different position.

- Choice 2 shows the water level diagonally, which is not congruent with how water behaves under gravitational effects. The water¡¯s surface should be horizontal.

- Choice 3 again shows a horizontal level that mirrors the stable position but does not take into account the new bottom created by the rotation.

- Choice 4 correctly represents the water level being horizontal and the highest volume displaced towards the bottom of the newly positioned container, as the cavity is now oriented sideways.

Therefore, the correct choice is:
