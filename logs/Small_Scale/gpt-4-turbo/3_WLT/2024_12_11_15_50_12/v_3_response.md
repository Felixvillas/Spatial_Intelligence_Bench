When a container filled with water is rotated, the free surface of the water always remains horizontal relative to the Earth, due to gravity. This means that as we look at the container in the new position, the surface of the water will appear as a horizontal line through the middle of the container's new diamond shape orientation.

Reviewing the given choices:
- **Choice 1** shows the water slanting across the container, which is incorrect since water would seek a level horizontal line.
- **Choice 2** also shows the water slanted, which is incorrect for the same reason.
- **Choice 3** indicates a completely horizontal water level but positioned at the bottom, suggesting not enough water to reach a higher level.
- **Choice 4** shows a horizontal water line that fills the container up to some height in its diamond-shaped position. This matches the expectation as the surface stays horizontal and the absolute water level doesn¡¯t change simply by rotating the container.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
