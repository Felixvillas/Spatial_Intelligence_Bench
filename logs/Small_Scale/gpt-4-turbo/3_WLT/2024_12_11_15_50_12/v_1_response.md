When the container is rotated as described in the question, the surface of the water inside will always adjust so that it is perpendicular to the direction of gravity. Irrespective of the container's shape or orientation, the water will find its level providing a flat and horizontal surface if unrestricted by container geometry.

1. In Choice 1, the water level line is horizontal but very close to the bottom, which is incorrect because there would be no reason for the water to significantly reduce its surface area unless leakage or evaporation occurred.
2. In Choice 2, the water level is shown as a diagonal. This does not comply with the behavior of liquids under the influence of gravity in a non-accelerating frame where they form a horizontal surface.
3. In Choice 3, the water level is horizontal and approximately at the same height relative to the container's dimension as in the first image. This is unlikely because the rotated stance does not align with the depiction in the other potential images.
4. Choice 4 shows the water level as a straight, horizontal line at an elevation consistent with the container's rotated position. This aligns with the understanding that the water maintains a level surface from the container's base considering the rotation.

Thus, the correct depiction of water in the rotated container corresponds to what physics would predict, matching the information provided in this scenario.
