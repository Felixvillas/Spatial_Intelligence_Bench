To determine the correct water level when the container is rotated, consider the behavior of the water, which will always try to maintain a level surface in response to gravity.

1. **Initial State**: The water fills the bottom portion of the container uniformly.
2. **Rotated State**: When the container is tilted, the water will still settle evenly along the new lower side due to gravity.

By observing the images:
- Choice 1 shows the water sloped, which is incorrect because water seeks a level surface.
- Choice 2 shows the water settling at an angle, which is also incorrect for the same reason.
- Choice 3 displays the water level spreading slightly up the walls, which is not typical for water in a tilted rectangular container.
- Choice 4 shows the water forming a level horizontal surface across the tilted container, correctly reflecting how water behaves under the influence of gravity.

Thus, the correct water level in the container when rotated is observed in Choice 4.
