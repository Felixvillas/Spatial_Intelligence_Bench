To determine the correct water level after rotating the container, we must consider how liquids behave under rotation. Liquids always try to maintain a horizontal level due to gravity. When the container is rotated, the orientation of the container changes, but the water level adjusts to remain horizontal with respect to gravity.

In the provided choices:
- Choice 1 shows the water level that is parallel to one side of the container, which is incorrect because the water will attempt to find an equilibrium where its surface remains horizontal relative to gravity.
- Choice 2 displays the water level as a diagonal that aligns with the new bottom edge of the rotated container. This is also incorrect because although it is diagonal relative to the edges of the container, it does not conform to the horizontal rule dictated by gravity.
- Choice 3 shows the water completely filling one side of the container, which misrepresents how water would distribute in a partially filled container.
- Choice 4 depicts the water level in a manner where the surface remains horizontal, consistent with the effects of gravity. This indicates that when the container is rotated, the water will shift to remain level at the bottom of the container's new orientation.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
