When the container is rotated, water, which always seeks to maintain a level surface relative to gravity, will redistribute itself along the new orientation of the container. The surface of the water will be parallel to the bottom of the screen, assuming standard gravitational conditions with no other forces acting on the water.

Given the choices presented:

- **Choice 1** shows the water at an angle, which is incorrect since the water level should remain horizontal relative to gravity.
- **Choice 2** shows the water angled in such a way that it appears as if the container were tilted forward or back relative to gravity, which is incorrect.
- **Choice 3** shows the water level horizontal from end to end of the tilted container, which is incorrect.
- **Choice 4** shows the water maintaining a horizontal level, parallel to the base of the container as it should be when the container is viewed as tilted but the influence of gravity is considered normally acting downwards.

Therefore, the correct representation of water level in a tilted container, considering typical gravitational effect, should be as depicted in:
