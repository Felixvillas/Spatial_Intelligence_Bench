When analyzing the effect of rotating the container filled with water, a fundamental principle to consider is that the free surface of a liquid at rest remains horizontal, reflecting a constant potential energy across the surface under the influence of gravity. This means no matter how the container is oriented, the surface of the water will endeavor to maintain a level that is perpendicular to the force of gravity.

In the first image you provided, the water level is parallel to the base of the square container. In the second image, the square container is rotated, but gravity's effect on the liquid remains the same; thus, the water within the container should adjust to ensure that its surface parallel to the base becomes the surface perpendicular to gravitational pull. This will result in the surface of the water aligning diagonally from one corner of the square to the opposite corner to remain horizontal.

Therefore, among the choices provided:
- Choice 1 is incorrect; the water level incorrectly remains parallel to the base of the rotated container.
- Choice 2 shows the water leveled diagonally across the square, which agrees with the effect of gravity and the rotation of the container. 
- Choices 3 and 4 also show the water level incorrectly remaining parallel to parts of the container, just covering different portions.

Thus, the correct answer based on the horizontal water-level principle is:
