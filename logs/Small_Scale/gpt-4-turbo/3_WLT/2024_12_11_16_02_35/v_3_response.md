When the container is rotated, it maintains the same volume of water but the orientation of the container's flat base changes from horizontal to diagonal. Consequently, the water inside will adjust to find the new lowest level while still covering the same base area, meaning the surface of water will be parallel to the base of the new container orientation.

Upon examination of the choices:
- Choice 1 shows water at an angle, which does not align with the new base level.
- Choice 2 also shows water at an incorrect angle.
- Choice 3 displays water covering the smallest base portion of the container, which is incorrect as the volume hasn't changed.
- Choice 4 depicts water parallel to the base of the container and aligns with the behavior of fluids within a rotated enclosure.

Thus, we select:
