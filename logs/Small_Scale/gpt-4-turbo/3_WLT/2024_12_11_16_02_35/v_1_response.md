When the container is rotated as shown, the water inside the container will adjust its level to maintain the natural level, aligning with gravity's pull vertically. This means that despite the container's rotation, the water will seek to level itself horizontally across the widest internal dimension of the container. Looking closely at the choices provided:

- Choice 1 shows water at the bottom, which isn't feasible as the container's rotation causes the bottom to be narrower than the middle where the water should collect more.
- Choice 2 shows the water at an angle, which is incorrect because water does not hold an angle when at rest in a rotating frame like this; it seeks a level.
- Choice 3 is similar to choice 1 and does not adjust the water level to the change in container orientation.
- Choice 4 shows water leveling horizontally across the container, matching the natural behavior of water seeking the lowest level in its new orientation.

Thus, based on this understanding:
