From examining the initial pieces and the choices provided:

1. The top piece of the initial image has a straight, flat bottom and a curved top, which looks like it could form the top curve of a circle.
2. The middle piece is thin and elongated, suggesting it might wrap as a line segment within a circle.
3. The bottom piece seems like it could fit in as the bottom portion of a circle with its curved top.

Comparing these pieces to the choices provided:

- **Choice 1** has segmented lines inside the circle that don't correspond to any of the pieces with their original shapes.
- **Choice 2** features similar lines as choice 1.
- **Choice 3** shows a simple circular shape, but the lines added do not match the puzzle pieces from the first image.
- **Choice 4** shows all pieces from the first image clearly integrated: the bottom curve of the circle fits with the bottom piece, the top flat piece fits into the top shape of the circle, and the small middle piece can be seen as a line crossing close to the center.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
