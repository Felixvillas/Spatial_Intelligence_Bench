To determine which choice shows how the puzzle pieces fit together, we should look for the layout that can comprise all the specific shapes from the scattered puzzle pieces in the image:

1. There are five distinct puzzle pieces that vary in shape and size:
   - Three larger quadrilaterals (roughly parallelogram or distorted rectangular shapes).
   - One smaller quadrilateral.
   - One very small triangle.

2. Let's analyze each option:
   - **Choice 1:** Incorporates various shapes but the segmentation and size of the pieces don't clearly align with those in the puzzle pieces shown.
   - **Choice 2:** Shows a better match in terms of the lines and shapes, but one of the lines dividing the quadrilateral is horizontally flat which does not appear in the original puzzle pieces.
   - **Choice 3:** The division and orientation of the lines better reflect the shapes and sizes of the original puzzle pieces, fitting them more closely compared to the other options.
   - **Choice 4:** Similar to Choice 2, but again the alignment and sizes of the lines and shapes are slightly off compared to the original pieces.

Given this analysis, Choice 3 aligns best with the puzzle pieces depicted in terms of how they fit together, considering the shape and orientation of each line within the quad.
