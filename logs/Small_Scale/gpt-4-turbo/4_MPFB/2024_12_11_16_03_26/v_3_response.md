Firstly, let¡¯s identify and match the specific shapes and orientations of the puzzle pieces from the first image with the completed options to find the best fit.

1. **Puzzle Pieces Breakdown (from the original image)**:
   - Two larger parallelograms.
   - Two smaller parallelograms (one very narrow).
   - One rectangle.

2. **Matching with the Choices**:
   - **Choice 1**: Contains shapes that approximate to the original but orientations do not perfectly match (e.g., orientation of the narrow parallelogram).
   - **Choice 2**: Contains a configuration where one of the larger parallelograms' orientation clearly does not match.
   - **Choice 3**: The shapes and their sizes match correctly with the original puzzle pieces, including the orientation of the narrow parallelogram, making it the closest match.
   - **Choice 4**: Similar to choice 3, but the positioning of the narrow parallelogram marginally differs, making it slightly inconsistent with the original puzzle layout.

From this analysis, the shapes and corresponding orientations in **Choice 3** best match the original puzzle pieces¡¯ layout and sizes.
