Analyzing the shapes of the individual puzzle pieces in the original image:

1. Two squares.
2. Two parallelograms (one with obtuse angles similar to a rhomboid and another with acute angles).
3. One triangle.

Now reviewing the choices provided:

- **Choice 1**: Contains one square, three parallelogram-like shapes, and one triangle embedded within another. This configuration does not match the original pieces.
- **Choice 2**: Includes one square, three parallelogram shapes, and one smaller triangle. The angles and proportions of some pieces do not correspond correctly to the original pieces.
- **Choice 3**: Features two squares, one parallelogram, and one triangle which more closely match the original pieces both in number and shape.
- **Choice 4**: This arrangement includes two squares, a triangle, and two parallelograms. However, the fitting together of these shapes isn't as clear as in choice 3.

From this evaluation, **Choice 3** appears to be the best match where the number of each shape and their configurations align closely with the original pieces. Thus, the answer is:
