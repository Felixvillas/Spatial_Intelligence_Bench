Analyzing the given puzzle pieces and fitting them into the choices provided:

1. The original pieces include one square, two parallelograms, and one narrow triangle. The pieces are rotated differently.
2. The challenge is to identify which choice has identical pieces correctly positioned together to recreate a square while fitting the original shapes without overlap or gaps.
   
- **Choice 1** shows various triangular and polygonal shapes, but they do not clearly match the original parallelograms and the square shape seems distorted.
- **Choice 2** displays a configuration where pieces are more rectangular and don't directly correspond to the original shapes, particularly the narrow triangle.
- **Choice 3** has a configuration where one parallelogram can be distinctly seen, but the integration of the square and narrow triangle is unclear.
- **Choice 4** presents a pattern where each piece is reminiscent of the original pieces' orientations and shapes.

Upon careful examination, **Choice 4** seems to align best with the original puzzle pieces' shape and orientation, matching the narrow triangle as well as the square.

Thus, the answer should be:

```

    "answer": 4
