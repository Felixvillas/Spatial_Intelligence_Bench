The original puzzle pieces consist of four quadrilaterals and one small triangle. Each piece has specific angles and sides that need to be examined to determine which final assembled choice matches exactly.

By examining each choice carefully:
1. Choice 1 has one triangle and four quadrilateral pieces. The shapes and their intersections do not correspond exactly with the initial pieces.
2. Choice 2 has a correct outline and seems visually to closely match the pieces, but the internal line creating a smaller rectangular piece doesn¡¯t match any of the original pieces.
3. Choice 3 shows a layout that doesn¡¯t fit the original triangle size correctly when compared to the quadrilateral pieces.
4. Choice 4 has the correct number of shapes and seems to most accurately fit the layout and shape of the original pieces, fitting the arrangements of the lines and match the sizes of each piece well.

Therefore, the correct option where all pieces are assembled correctly as per the shapes and lines appears to be:
