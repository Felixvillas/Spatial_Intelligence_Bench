Analyzing the provided puzzle pieces and the options:

- The first puzzle piece is a rounded top part with a straight bottom.
- The second piece is a slightly curved bottom part.
- The third piece is two small, flat oval shapes.

Now considering the choices to match these pieces:
- **Choice 1** shows a circle with two curved lines across and one vertical, but no part perfectly matches the given pieces.
- **Choice 2** features similar markings to Choice 1, again with no perfect match to the outlined pieces.
- **Choice 3** displays a circle with two small ovals similar to the third piece and a continuous outside circle aligning with the first two main puzzle pieces.
- **Choice 4** includes parts that resemble the top straight-lined piece and the bottom curved piece, with the small ovals fitting outside, but the overall placing and curvature of lines slightly vary.

Given the clues and detail matching, **Choice 3** most accurately reflects the joining of all the original pieces while respecting the shape and forms of the described elements.
