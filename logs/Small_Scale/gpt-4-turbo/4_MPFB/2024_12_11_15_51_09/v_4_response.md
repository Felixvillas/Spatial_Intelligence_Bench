Analyzing the puzzle pieces from the original image:

- The first piece is a slightly curved top, which appears to be a part of a rounded top or cap shape.
- The second piece is a full semicircle shape.
- The third piece is a small, thin oval or capsule-like shape.

Now, examining how these shapes could be integrated into the provided options to form a coherent image:

- Choice 1: Shows a ball with one wide vertical line and one narrow one. None of the pieces in the original image seem to clearly fit this pattern.
- Choice 2: Displays a ball divided by two thin, vertical lines. It does not distinctly mirror the pieces from the puzzle.
- Choice 3: Presents a ball with a thick outline, but only with a small circle and a separate thick curve on top. It resembles some pieces but doesn't quite fit perfectly.
- Choice 4: Features an intact sphere with a top gap, a horizontal line at the bottom, and a smooth continuous curve fitting the curved top piece. This correlates the most accurately with the original puzzle pieces, especially the curved top fitting neatly into the gap on the sphere.

Each piece in the original image can be logically fitted into the layout as seen in Choice 4.
