First, let's analyze the individual pieces provided in the initial image:

1. The pieces include two trapezoids, a smaller right-angled triangle, a rhombus, and three quadrilaterals of various shapes.

Now, let's examine each choice to see which one correctly fits these pieces into a square without changing the shape or size of any piece:

- **Choice 1** appears to fit all the puzzle pieces without altering their shapes or sizes. The lines match the corners, and each piece can be identified from the original set. 
- **Choice 2** shows all corners and angles fitting; however, the arrangement and angles of some pieces slightly differ from those in the original puzzle pieces.
- **Choice 3** does not quite fit. The alignment of some lines and the placement of the smaller triangle do not correspond with the configurations in the provided pieces.
- **Choice 4** shows similar issues to Choice 3, where the placement of pieces does not precisely match the original pieces.

Upon matching the pieces accurately and considering all angles and lines, **Choice 1** seems to accurately represent the assembled puzzle.
