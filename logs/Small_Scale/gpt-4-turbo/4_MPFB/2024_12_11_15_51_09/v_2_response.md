To solve the puzzle, we need to match the shapes and orientations of the pieces from the initial image with the completed puzzle option.

1. The initial image shows five pieces: two squares, one rectangle angled at about 45 degrees, one small narrow rectangle (almost a line), and one diamond shaped piece.
2. The pieces must fit together to form a larger square, as evident from the four choices provided.

Let's examine each choice to see which fits the description correctly:
- **Choice 1**: Contains multiple triangle-like and quadrilateral shapes that do not match the original pieces (squares and diamond are missing).
- **Choice 2**: Contains a layout and shape fitting our pieces: two squares, a rectangle, a narrow rectangle (placed diagonally), and a diamond shape.
- **Choice 3**: Lacks a proper diamond shape; placement of pieces doesn't exactly fit the original shapes.
- **Choice 4**: Pieces include a diamond, but the orientation and combination of other shapes (especially the squares and rectangle) do not align well with the initial pieces.

After comparing the shapes and their orientations, Choice 2 is the most accurate representation of the original puzzle pieces when assembled.
