The puzzle consists of various geometric shapes, and it is essential to match the shapes precisely to determine which option correctly assembles them. Analyzing the first image:

1. The first image shows six puzzle pieces of different geometric shapes.

From the four options given:

- **Choice 1** has multiple lines that do not correspond to any single piece from the original image.
- **Choice 2** is similar, containing a horizontal line that doesn't match any of the original puzzle pieces.
- **Choice 3** has pieces that, on closer examination, don¡¯t match the shapes in the original puzzle image.
- **Choice 4** seems to closely match the original shapes in terms of both the configuration and the angles of the lines defining each piece.

Thus, here is the answer in the required JSON format:
