From observing the puzzle pieces provided in the image, we see that the pieces include a curved top part, a protruding semi-circular bottom piece, and two small oval pieces. When assembling these puzzle pieces together in the shape of an object, one needs to consider how they fit to form a continuous outer boundary.

Now, examining the options given:
- **Choice 1** presents a circle with segmented lines, but these lines do not reflect the shapes of the puzzle pieces.
- **Choice 2** shows a similar design as Choice 1, but the lines here also do not map well to the specific puzzle shapes.
- **Choice 3** is a clean circle with a top and side circular indentations, which does not seem to accommodate the shapes correctly.
- **Choice 4** includes a curved top matching the top puzzle piece and another line that could feasibly accommodate the semi-circular protrusion at the base, fitting the large curved piece and creating a boundary that could align with the smaller pieces.

Based on these observations, **Choice 4** appears to be the best fit using all the puzzle pieces effectively to form an overall shape that closely resembles the sum of the parts.
