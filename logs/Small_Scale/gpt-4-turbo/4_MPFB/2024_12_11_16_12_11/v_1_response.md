To solve this, we must ensure that the pieces shown in the initial image match the assembled shapes in any of the choices, taking into consideration the size ratios, angles, and lines.

Reviewing each choice:
- **Choice 1**: The subdivision of the shapes doesn't accurately correspond with the individual pieces shown in the initial image. Some lines and angles don't align with the original pieces.
- **Choice 2**: Similar to Choice 1, the divisions between the pieces and the line angles don't entirely line up with the distinct shapes from the initial image.
- **Choice 3**: This arrangement also faces mismatch issues where the piece divisions within the larger shape don't seem to correctly reflect the original pieces' angles and proportions.
- **Choice 4**: This choice appears to align correctly with the shapes provided in the initial image. The piece divisions and the angles closely fit the original shapes' outlines and angles.

Given this analysis, it looks like Choice 4 correctly represents the pieces from the first image when assembled.
