From observing the original puzzle pieces, we have two rectangles, two squares, and one triangle. Analyzing how these pieces might fit into the given options:

- **Choice 1:** Contains one triangle, two rectangles, two small angled pieces (not perfectly square or rectangular).
- **Choice 2:** Includes one triangle, two rectangles, and two squares.
- **Choice 3:** Consists of one triangle, two rectangles, and two squares.
- **Choice 4:** Features one triangle, two rectangles, two squares.

The options with the potential correct arrangement of shapes are Choice 2, Choice 3, and Choice 4. However, considering the overall shape and the specific arrangement of the lines and junctions between pieces:

- **Choice 2:** The orientation and junctions of the pieces closely reflect the separation and configuration of the original shapes when observed closely.

Hence, the answer based on the detailed observation of how the puzzle pieces might match is:
