To determine which choice correctly represents the assembled puzzle from the given pieces in the provided image, we need to compare the shapes and orientations of the individual pieces against the possible assemblies shown in the four choices.

The original pieces include:
1. Two rectangles (one larger and one smaller).
2. Two slimmer quadrilaterals (each appearing almost like a stretched trapezoid or a parallelogram).
3. One larger quadrilateral that seems like a skewed rectangle.

Now, examining each of the choices against the given pieces:
- **Choice 1** seems to include all the pieces but the placement and connections between them don't quite match some of the uniquely angled original pieces.
- **Choice 2** closely matches with the larger skewed rectangle aligning towards the top right, and the slimmer quadrilaterals fitting neatly, reminiscent of the original configuration.
- **Choice 3 and 4** do contain elements that match, but their arrangements or addition of lines not present in the original disjoint pieces make them less likely.

Given the closest visual correspondence in terms of both shape and fit:
