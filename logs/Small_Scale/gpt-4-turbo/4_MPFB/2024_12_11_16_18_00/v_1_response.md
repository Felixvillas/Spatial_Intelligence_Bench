To find the correct assembly of the pieces from the original image, let's analyze the configurations in each choice:

1. **Choice 1** has multiple diagonals and a small triangular piece at the bottom right that does not match any of the loose pieces closely from the original image.
   
2. **Choice 2** features diagonals that match the angles seen in the original pieces. However, a horizontal line across the middle square perimeter is inconsistent with the sloping lines typically seen in the original pieces.
   
3. **Choice 3** includes a misplacement as part of the puzzle is not aligned perfectly, and the lines and angles do not correspond entirely with the original pieces¡¯ shapes and arrangements.
   
4. **Choice 4** shows a configuration that is a perfect fit with the original shapes where all lines match the original pieces' angles, and the overall geometry fits the shapes from the original image.

Based on the analysis, Choice 4 is the correct assembly of the pieces.
