In the provided puzzle pieces image, we have:
- One curved, dome-like piece that forms a major portion of the outline.
- One crescent piece that fits alongside a corner or curve.
- One smaller curved piece.

By examining the choices:
- Choice 1 has one large area that could fit the dome piece but has only one clear division that doesn't match the crescent or smaller piece alignments.
- Choice 2 also has one large piece but does not clearly show how the smaller pieces would attach based on their shapes.
- Choice 3 depicts a clearer fit with a main body for the dome piece, a smaller piece fitting into the circle's curve like the crescent piece, and another area for the smaller curved piece.
- Choice 4 also has a main dome-like space, but the smaller piece arrangements don't seem to match as cleanly as in Choice 3.

From the visual alignment and the unmistakable fit of the crescent and smaller curved pieces in the provided constructions, Choice 3 is the most likely outcome when the pieces are put together.
