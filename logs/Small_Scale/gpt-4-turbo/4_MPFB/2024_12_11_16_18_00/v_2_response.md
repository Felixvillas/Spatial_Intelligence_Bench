Based on an analysis of each diagram, the shapes in Choice 4 most closely match the original pieces shown in the first image:

1. The square piece in the top left of the original image resembles the bottom right square of Choice 4.
2. The tilted rectangle or quadrilateral fits nearly into the bottom left of the Choice 4.
3. The angle and the positioning of the two slimmer quadrilaterals (one on the middle right and the other in the top of Choice 4) match the original pieces.

Choices 1, 2, and 3 have discrepancies in matching the size and angles of at least one of the pieces when compared to the original set.

Therefore, the correct configuration is represented by:
