From the perspective of standing at the fish and facing the bat, you must visualize the field of view relative to this orientation:

1. The fish is positioned at the bottom of the image.
2. The bat, which you are facing, is located at the top middle part of the image, directly "above" you if you are the fish.
3. The grape is on the lower right from the fish, almost perpendicular to the direction towards the bat.

Facing the bat and considering your view from the fish, if we assume facing the bat is looking north, then the grape would be to your right. Therefore, you need to turn right (or clockwise) to see the grape.

The relative positioning of the grape is roughly 90 degrees to the right (east) when considering the direct line towards the bat from the fish.

Thus, the answer based on your options and given description is:
