We then visualize a line from the bat to the apple.\\n\\nFrom the image:\\n- The book is directly to the left of the bat.\\n- The apple is located slightly to the left and upward direction from the bat.\\n\\nSince the apple is not directly upward (which would be -90 degrees) but slightly less to the left, the angle to the apple relative from the bat facing the book is slightly less than -90 degrees. Among the given options, -115 degrees is too large, and -15 degrees is too small and in the opposite quadrant.\\n\\nThus, the most plausible angle for the apple relative to the bat facing the book is around -55 degrees.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer option is:\\n```\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 4\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733904409,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 171,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 403,\n        \"total_tokens\": 574,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
