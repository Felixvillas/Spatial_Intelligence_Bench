First, we establish the direction facing the book as the forward or 0-degree direction. We then visualize a line from the bat to the apple.

From the image:
- The book is directly to the left of the bat.
- The apple is located slightly to the left and upward direction from the bat.

Since the apple is not directly upward (which would be -90 degrees) but slightly less to the left, the angle to the apple relative from the bat facing the book is slightly less than -90 degrees. Among the given options, -115 degrees is too large, and -15 degrees is too small and in the opposite quadrant.

Thus, the most plausible angle for the apple relative to the bat facing the book is around -55 degrees.

Therefore, the correct answer option is:
