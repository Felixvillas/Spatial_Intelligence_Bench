From the cake position, facing the desk is the direct line of sight forward. Looking at the image, we note the positions of the objects in relation to this viewpoint.

The bat is to the right and slightly forward relative to the cake's position and facing direction (towards the desk). Since the bat is on the right, the rotation needed to face towards the bat would be clockwise, yielding a positive angle.

Estimating the angle visually, the bat appears right but not far off from being straight ahead. Hence, the angle, in this case, is likely small. From the provided options, the most fitting choice for a small positive angle would be:
