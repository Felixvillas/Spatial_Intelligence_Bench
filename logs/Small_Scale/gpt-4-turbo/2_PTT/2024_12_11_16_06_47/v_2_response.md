First, to determine the relative angle of the book from the position of the grapes facing the donut, we need to ascertain the direction and angle between the mentioned points.

1. The grapes are located bottom left of the image.
2. The donut is located toward the right middle side of the image.
3. The book is located toward the upper right-hand corner of the image.

Visualizing this, if you are standing at the grapes and facing directly towards the donut, this establishes your forward direction straight from grapes (left) to the donut (right).

To locate the book from this facing position, you would turn slightly towards your right. Therefore, the angle is positive (rotating clockwise).

Among the given options (-17, -77, -57, -37), none are positive. Reviewing the scenario, it appears there may be a mistake in the interpretation or description of the options, as standing at the grapes and facing the donut would result in a need to turn to your right (a positive angle) to face the book.

However, following the provided options and assuming a possible mistake in angle understanding or assuming that we have to pick from available options, the angle closest to our observation (albeit of opposite sign convention) which is least would be:
