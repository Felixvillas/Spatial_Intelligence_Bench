This alignment represents the 0-degree direction.\\n  \\n2. **Locating the Apple**: From the central position of the bat facing the book, the apple is slightly to your left back side.\\n\\n3. **Estimating the Angle**: Given that the apple is to the back and slightly to the left, it implies an angle close to -90 degrees but not that far back. Considering the options provided, the angle closest to this description would be slightly less than -90 degrees but not quite towards -180 degrees.\\n\\n4. **Choosing the Closest Option**: Of the provided options -35, -15, -115, and -55, the option -55 degrees would be the most accurate representation of the relative position described, which also fits within the appropriate range.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the structured JSON response would be:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 4\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733903373,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 205,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 403,\n        \"total_tokens\": 608,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
