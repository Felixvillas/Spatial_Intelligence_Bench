Standing at the grapes, you are facing towards the donut.\\n2. If you draw a straight line from the grapes to the donut, this line represents the direction of 0 degrees.\\n3. The book is above and slightly to the right of the grapes in the image.\\n4. From the grapes, to face toward the book, you would have to rotate slightly to the left (anti-clockwise).\\n\\nGiven these positions:\\n- Anti-clockwise rotations are negative.\\n- Since the rotation to face the book from the donut direction is slight, the angle is a slight negative value.\\n\\nConsidering the options, the one that most closely represents a small anti-clockwise rotation is:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 4\\n}\\n```\\nHere, option 4 (-37 degrees) represents a slight and reasonable anti-clockwise adjustment from the donut to the book.\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733903380,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 206,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 404,\n        \"total_tokens\": 610,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
