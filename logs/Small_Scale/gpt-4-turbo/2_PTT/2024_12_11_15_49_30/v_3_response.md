In the image, the cake is situated towards the bottom left and the desk is towards the bottom right. If standing at the cake and facing the desk, you would be looking towards the right side of the image.

The bat is positioned towards the middle and slightly higher than both the cake and the desk. From the perspective of someone at the cake facing the desk, the bat would be located roughly forward and slightly to the left.

Now, estimating the angle relative to the forward direction (to the desk):
- Direct to the right would be 0 degrees.
- Slightly left of this direction would be a negative angle, but not significantly off-center.

Given the options provided, the most suitable angle from the perspective would be a slight negative number since the bat is left of the direct line towards the desk. Based on the given options:
- -19бу
- 21бу
- 1бу
- -39бу

The most plausible angle would be -19 degrees, as it reflects a slight deviation to the left. Thus, the answer would be:
