To determine the location of the grapes relative to the position of the fish facing the bat, follow these steps:

1. Identify the fish as the point of perspective, facing the direction of the bat.
2. The bat is directly in line with the fish, which means facing the bat from the fish establishes the forward direction (or 0 degrees).
3. The grapes are positioned to the right of this line (when facing from the fish to the bat), meaning they are somewhere within the 0 to 180 degrees range on the clockwise (positive) side.
4. We estimate the angle considering the position of the grapes relative to the direct line of sight from the fish to the bat. The position of the grapes is considerably to the right but not completely perpendicular (which would be 90 degrees). They are not far right enough to be at a sharp angle (like 45 degrees), but also not quite aligned close to straight right like 90 degrees, suggesting a smaller angle.

Given the angles provided in the options, the closest reasonable estimate is \(47\) degrees clockwise from the direct forward line (tow,ards the bat). Therefore, the correct choice that represents this analysis is option 1 (47 degrees).
