To determine the angle at which the apple is located relative to the bat:

1. **Starting Position**: Start facing towards the book. This alignment represents the 0-degree direction.
  
2. **Locating the Apple**: From the central position of the bat facing the book, the apple is slightly to your left back side.

3. **Estimating the Angle**: Given that the apple is to the back and slightly to the left, it implies an angle close to -90 degrees but not that far back. Considering the options provided, the angle closest to this description would be slightly less than -90 degrees but not quite towards -180 degrees.

4. **Choosing the Closest Option**: Of the provided options -35, -15, -115, and -55, the option -55 degrees would be the most accurate representation of the relative position described, which also fits within the appropriate range.

Based on this analysis, the structured JSON response would be:
