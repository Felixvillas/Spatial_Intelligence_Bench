From the chair's position and facing the dog, the described scenario places the chair facing the upwards direction on the image plane where the dog is located. By assuming this orientation:
- Directly upward (0 degrees) points towards the dog.
- Leftward (-90 degrees) would be to the left side from the perspective of someone sitting in the chair.
- Rightward (90 degrees) points towards the right.
- Directly downward (180 or -180 degrees) would be behind the chair.

Now, the apple is placed to the right side of the chair (when facing the dog), thus it is at a 90 degrees angle from the chair's perspective.

Based on the options provided, the correct answer reflecting the apple's location relative to the chair is:
