First, let's define the front direction from the cake to the desk. This direction will function as the positive x-axis in our coordinate system, designating straight ahead. From this perspective, any object located directly towards the desk is at 0 degrees.

The bat is located to the left or in terms of our coordinate system description, in the negative angle direction from the cake. To find out the angle, imagine a line drawn from the cake directly to the desk, and another line from the cake to the bat. The angle we need is between these two lines.

The bat lies visibly to the left and at an upward angle relative to the straight line running from the cake to the desk. This placement suggests a small negative angle, likely between -20 and 0 degrees.

Looking at the given options and considering the placement of the bat relative to an imagined horizontal line running through the cake:
- -19 degrees would make sense, as it is negative (indicating left of the positive x-axis direction), and sufficiently small to match the visual light upward angle.

Thus, the closest choice given the positions and estimation:
