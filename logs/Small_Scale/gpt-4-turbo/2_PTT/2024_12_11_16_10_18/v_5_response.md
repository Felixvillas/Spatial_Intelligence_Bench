To determine the angle of the grapes relative to the fish facing the bat, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the orientation of these items in the image:
   - The fish faces towards the left.
   - The bat is above and slightly to the right of the fish.
   - The grapes are located below the fish.

2. When facing the bat from the fish¡¯s perspective, consider the bat to be in the general direction of up (north). Therefore, you would rotate clockwise from facing left (west):

   - Rotate from left (west) to up (north) would be a 90-degree clockwise turn.

3. Now consider the location of grapes:
   - Grapes are directly below the fish. If we consider the bat to be north, the grapes would then be behind where the fish originally faced, making it south.
   - From the new north-facing position (towards the bat), the grapes would be behind (south).

4. Determining the relative location:
   - Moving clockwise from the north-facing position (bat) to the south-facing position (grapes) involves a 180-degree turn.

Since the 180-degree option is not given, and the closest approximation in the reverse direction (anticlockwise, which is designated negative) would reflect a south direction immediately opposite of north. Thus, the answer would be effectively approaching -180 degrees. But from the provided options and considering the standard turn from facing forward to directly backward (opposite direction), the most direct way to express this in our choices (without explicitly hitting -180 degrees) would be half a complete circle (90 degrees), but negative as the movement needs to be anticlockwise from the front (north) to back (south). Therefore, the grape, relative to the fish-oriented north, would be exactly behind, which translates to -180 degrees in standard calculation but approximated here as -90 degree for a half turn (note, you've to choose from given options):
