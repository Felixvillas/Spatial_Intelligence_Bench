To determine the location of the book relative to the grapes when facing the donut, follow these steps:

1. Establish directions: The grapes are at the bottom, and the donut is at the far right, signifying the direction you are facing.

2. Establish the relative position of the book to the grapes: The book is upwards and slightly towards the right from the grapes.

3. Estimate the angle from the direction of the donut: Since directly right (facing the donut) is 0 degrees, moving clockwise from the donut towards the book, you would go upwards and to the right. This is a counterclockwise rotation.

By visualization, the angle appears to fall in the second quadrant, nearer to straight up (which would be -90 degrees). It looks to be somewhat moderate between -90 degrees and horizontal (-0 degrees), indicating that an estimate close to -57 degrees would be reasonable.

Thus, the answer is:
