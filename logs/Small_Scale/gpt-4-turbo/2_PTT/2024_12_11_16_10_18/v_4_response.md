From the original orientation where you're standing at the chair and facing the dog, the dog appears directly in front of you. This sets the forward direction or 0 degrees directly towards the dog.

To find the location of the apple relative to this position:
- The apple is to the right of the current forward-facing direction towards the dog.

Given the axes set, turning from facing the dog to facing the apple forms a quadrant on the right, indicating a positive rotation. This positioning suggests a 90-degree clockwise turn. Therefore, the angle at which the apple is located relative to facing the dog is 90 degrees.

Hence, the appropriate answer from the supplied options is:
