To determine the angle of the apple relative to the position and orientation of the bat, we have to consider the following steps based on the image:

1. Identify the direction in which the bat is facing. From the image, we know that if you're standing at the bat and facing the book, you're facing up on the image (towards the top of the picture where the book is).

2. Location of the Apple: The apple is positioned to the left of the bat and slightly up from it.

3. Determining the Angle:
   - Since you're facing up (or "north" in the image), any object to your left is towards the west.
   - The apple is positioned mostly left from your perspective, which implies a turn towards the negative direction (anti-clockwise).
   - The angle needed isn't very steep (more of a slight diagonal), so an angle around -45 degrees could be a first guess. However, we need to choose from the provided options.

Among the choices given:
- -35
- -15
- -115
- -55

The angle -55 degrees (option 4) seems like a plausible estimate since it suggests a more moderate turn to the left (west) from the bat's upwards (north) facing position.
