Establish directions: The grapes are at the bottom, and the donut is at the far right, signifying the direction you are facing.\\n\\n2. Establish the relative position of the book to the grapes: The book is upwards and slightly towards the right from the grapes.\\n\\n3. Estimate the angle from the direction of the donut: Since directly right (facing the donut) is 0 degrees, moving clockwise from the donut towards the book, you would go upwards and to the right. This is a counterclockwise rotation.\\n\\nBy visualization, the angle appears to fall in the second quadrant, nearer to straight up (which would be -90 degrees). It looks to be somewhat moderate between -90 degrees and horizontal (-0 degrees), indicating that an estimate close to -57 degrees would be reasonable.\\n\\nThus, the answer is:\\n```\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 3\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733904633,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 205,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 404,\n        \"total_tokens\": 609,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
