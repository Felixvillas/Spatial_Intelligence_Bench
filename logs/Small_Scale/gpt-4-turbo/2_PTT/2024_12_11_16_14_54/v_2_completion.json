The grapes are at the bottom-center, and the donut is at the bottom-right of the image. This means the direct path of sight or facing direction is to the right.\\n\\n2. **Identifying location of the book**: From the grapes, if you look towards the upper-middle left side of the image, the book is located there.\\n\\n3. **Estimating the angle**: The book is roughly to the left while facing the donut from the grapes. To turn to the book, you would need to make an anti-clockwise rotation. The book is not directly to the left (which would be a -90 degree turn) but slightly towards the upper side. Therefore, the angle should be slightly less than -90 degrees, making it approximately between -45 to -90 degrees.\\n\\n4. **Choosing the closest option**: Among the provided options (-17, -77, -57, -37), -77 degrees is the value that comes closest to this estimation, aligning with a more precise anti-clockwise turn from the grapes to the book.\\n\\nSo, the JSON response would be:\\n```\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 2\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733904924,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 279,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 404,\n        \"total_tokens\": 683,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
