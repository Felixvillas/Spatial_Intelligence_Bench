When standing at the bat and facing the book, the positive direction for angle measurement will be clockwise, and negative will be anti-clockwise.

1. The book is directly ahead, which sets the 0 degrees reference point.
2. To locate the apple from this position:
   - Rotating from the book directly to the apple involves a movement mainly to the right in a clockwise fashion.
   - The apple appears to be slightly right of the direct path between the bat and the book, indicating it is at a small positive angle.

Comparing the given options and considering the relative positioning of the apple (slightly to the right), the angle is most likely small and positive.

The options provided are:
- -35
- -15
- -115
- -55

None of these angles seem to directly represent a slight positive value, however, considering visual interpretation, the smallest negative angle might be the closest to what might have been a slight positive angle error in printing or interpretation of the angles. -15 degrees being the least negative, suggests the smallest deviation counterclockwise, and potentially closest to what should have been a small positive angle that wasn't an option.
