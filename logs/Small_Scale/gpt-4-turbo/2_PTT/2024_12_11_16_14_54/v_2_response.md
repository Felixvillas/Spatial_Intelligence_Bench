To find the relative angle of the book from the position of the grapes and facing the donut, here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Position and direction identification**: Standing at the grapes, facing the donut. The grapes are at the bottom-center, and the donut is at the bottom-right of the image. This means the direct path of sight or facing direction is to the right.

2. **Identifying location of the book**: From the grapes, if you look towards the upper-middle left side of the image, the book is located there.

3. **Estimating the angle**: The book is roughly to the left while facing the donut from the grapes. To turn to the book, you would need to make an anti-clockwise rotation. The book is not directly to the left (which would be a -90 degree turn) but slightly towards the upper side. Therefore, the angle should be slightly less than -90 degrees, making it approximately between -45 to -90 degrees.

4. **Choosing the closest option**: Among the provided options (-17, -77, -57, -37), -77 degrees is the value that comes closest to this estimation, aligning with a more precise anti-clockwise turn from the grapes to the book.
