The book is directly ahead, which sets the 0 degrees reference point.\\n2. To locate the apple from this position:\\n   - Rotating from the book directly to the apple involves a movement mainly to the right in a clockwise fashion.\\n   - The apple appears to be slightly right of the direct path between the bat and the book, indicating it is at a small positive angle.\\n\\nComparing the given options and considering the relative positioning of the apple (slightly to the right), the angle is most likely small and positive.\\n\\nThe options provided are:\\n- -35\\n- -15\\n- -115\\n- -55\\n\\nNone of these angles seem to directly represent a slight positive value, however, considering visual interpretation, the smallest negative angle might be the closest to what might have been a slight positive angle error in printing or interpretation of the angles. -15 degrees being the least negative, suggests the smallest deviation counterclockwise, and potentially closest to what should have been a small positive angle that wasn't an option.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 2\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733904897,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 250,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 403,\n        \"total_tokens\": 653,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
