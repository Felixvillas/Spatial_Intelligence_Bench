To determine the angle at which the apple is located relative to the chair, while you are standing at the chair facing the dog, consider the following steps:

1. First, identify the direction you are facing. If you are at the chair facing the dog, your primary line of sight (0 degrees) is directed towards the dog.

2. The chair faces directly towards the dog (due east on this 2D map). 

3. Now, observe the relative position of the apple. The apple is located directly to the south of the chair.

4. To calculate the clockwise angle from the east (where the dog is) to the south (where the apple is), you move from east to south. This is a clockwise rotation, and the measure of this angle is 90 degrees.

Given the options provided and the analysis:
- 90 degrees is the amount of rotation required, using the clockwise positive rotation direction approach.

Thus, the answer JSON response would be:
