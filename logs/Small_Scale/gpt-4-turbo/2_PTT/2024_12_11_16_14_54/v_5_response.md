From the perspective of the fish facing the bat, we need to determine the relative angle to the grapes. To do this, we observe the arrangement of the objects:

1. The fish is at the bottom of the image.
2. The bat is directly above the fish.
3. The grapes are situated to the left side from the bat and fish.

If the fish is facing directly upwards towards the bat, this sets the direction straight up as 0 degrees or the north line. The grapes, being directly to the left of the fish when facing the bat, align west, which is -90 degrees from the north line, assuming clockwise rotations are positive and anti-clockwise rotations are negative.

Given the options:
- 47 degrees (Clockwise moderate northeast)
- 7 degrees (Clockwise slight north-northeast)
- -47 degrees (Anti-clockwise moderate northwest)
- 90 degrees (Right to the initial position, i.e., east)

The correct answer should be -90 degrees, but since this option isn¡¯t explicitly given in the list, the closest representation in terms of direction would be to the west. Thus the correct option is:
