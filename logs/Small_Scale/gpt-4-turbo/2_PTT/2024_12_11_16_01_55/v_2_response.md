In the given scenario, you are standing at the grapes and facing the donut. To calculate the angle to the book, here's the step-by-step visualization and calculation:

1. Your position is at the grapes.
2. You are facing directly towards the donut.
3. The direction from the grapes (your position) towards the donut is the forward direction (0 degrees).
4. Relative to this direction, find the angle to the book.

Looking at the image:
- The grapes to the donut forms a horizontal line across the screen. 
- The book is located below this horizontal line.

To find the clockwise angle:
- Moving clockwise from the line pointing towards the donut, you encounter the book on your way. This path moves to the right and slightly downward from the grapes.

The angle appears close to -45 degrees or slightly less. Let's compare with the given choices and the appearance roughly aligns with -37 degrees.

Thus, the angle of the book relative to you, facing the donut, is:
