To determine the angle at which the grapes are located relative to the fish's perspective facing the bat, follow these steps:

1. The fish faces the bat in the image.
2. Given the image, when facing the bat, the direct line from fish to bat is your reference direction (0 degrees).
3. Observing the direction of the grapes, they are to the left of this reference line when facing the bat.
4. In angular terms, the grapes are not directly perpendicular to the fish-bat line, as that would be -90 degrees. Instead, the grapes are slightly further back (less than -90 degrees) but not a full -180 degrees back.
5. The only option that fits this position in the given range (-180 to 180, with left/anticlockwise being negative) and considering typical horizontal or vertical angles on this image, is an option close to -90 but less than that.

Considering the options provided:
- -47 degrees would be clockwise if positive and less anticlockwise if negative. Since the grapes are significantly to the left (anticlockwise), and -47 degrees seems reasonable for their position somewhat past directly left of the fish facing the bat but not at a full -90 degree angle.

This aligns with our analysis and the plausible options. Hence the answer should be:
