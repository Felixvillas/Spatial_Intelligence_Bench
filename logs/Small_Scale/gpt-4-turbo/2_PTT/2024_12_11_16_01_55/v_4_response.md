In the image, if you are standing at the chair and facing the dog, the direction towards the dog is essentially the "forward" or 0 degrees direction.

The apple is positioned to the right relative to the chair. When moving from facing forward (towards the dog) to facing the apple, you would turn 90 degrees clockwise. 

Based on the given options where clockwise rotations are indicated as positive angles:
1) -85 (negative denotes a counterclockwise rotation)
2) -120 (similarly, a counterclockwise rotation)
3) 90 (clockwise, i.e., to the right)
4) 180 (directly behind)

The correct angle from the chair towards the apple as per the options given and described rotation would be 90 degrees clockwise. This corresponds to option 3.
