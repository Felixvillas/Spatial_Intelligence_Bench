First, let's visualize standing at the bat, facing the direction of the book. In this position, the book is directly in front of you at 0 degrees.

From this viewpoint, if you are looking at the book:
- A clockwise rotation is positive, and an anti-clockwise rotation is negative.

Given that the apple is to your left as you face the book:
- A movement to the left from facing the book represents an anti-clockwise rotation.

Estimating the angle based on the relative positions of the objects in the image:
- The apple appears to be approximately 45 to 60 degrees counter-clockwise from directly facing the book direction.

Matching this description with the angle options (-35, -15, -115, -55), the closest angle would be:
- -55 degrees, which corresponds to option 4.

Here's the json formatted answer:
