To determine which image shows the same object as in the initial image, rotated in 3D, I will closely examine the configuration of the blocks between the images.

In the initial image, the structure is a vertical column of four blocks with two blocks protruding from the second block from the bottom on the right side, and a horizontal row of four blocks intersects perpendicularly from the third block down.

Now, comparing this setup with the provided choices:
- Choice 1 seems to present the same orientation as the original image but merely rotated about a vertical axis.
- Choice 2 shows an evident change not only in orientation but also in the way the blocks at the intersection are arranged.
- Choice 3 has a different configuration, with the horizontal row originating from the top block in the vertical column.
- Choice 4 changes the direction and arrangement of blocks significantly compared to the original image.

Upon reevaluating Choice 1, it is evident that it matches the initial image in terms of block configuration, with the right shifts, alignments, and orientation only altered by a rotation view, not the structure itself. Therefore, the answer is:
