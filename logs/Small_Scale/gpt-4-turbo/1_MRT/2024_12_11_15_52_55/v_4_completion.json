From top to bottom, the configuration is 3 blocks, bending around with 2 blocks on one side and 2 additional blocks on another side, forming a distinct 'stepped' or 'zigzagged' arrangement.\\n\\n2. **Choice 1**: Appears to be an L-shape with 4 blocks on one part and 3 on another, differing significantly in configuration from the original with an orthogonal intersection not present in the original object.\\n\\n3. **Choice 2**: Features a mirrored L-shape similar to the original object but rotated such that the 3-block length intersects differently with the 4-block configuration compared to the original object.\\n\\n4. **Choice 3**: Configuration matches the original with 3 blocks arranged in a line, bending 90 degrees with 2 blocks and bending again to include two perpendicular blocks. The overall configuration and volume arrangement match those of the original object.\\n\\n5. **Choice 4**: The orientation seems slightly off, with a differing connection point of the 2-block piece compared to the original layout; this makes it distinct from the configuration seen in the original object.\\n\\nOn examining these descriptions, **Choice 3** indeed matches the rotation and layout of the original object.
