Analyzing the given images:

- The original image shows a three-dimensional shape resembling an elongated block figure laid out in an angular pattern.
- A close examination of how the blocks connect and align is essential to identify the correct rotated shape among the choices.

Reviewing the choices against the original:

1. **Choice 1** - The blocks are rotated in a way that maintains the connection angles and relative positioning seen in the original.
2. **Choice 2** - The orientation of some blocks changes the perceived depth significantly, creating an improbable match.
3. **Choice 3** - While there's a similarity in form, the upper portion's arrangement seems altered, making it less likely a correct match.
4. **Choice 4** - The orientation here appears to tilt in ways that the original's planes do not, making it a less likely match.

Based on the continuity of block connectivity and similar angles, **Choice 1** seems to be the same object rotated as it upholds the angles and connections most closely to the original image.
