Analyzing the configurations of cubes in the original image and comparing them with each choice:

1. In the original image, there is a prominent "L" shape upside down with three cubes projecting upwards in an "I" shape.
2. Choice 1 has a configuration that does not match the "L" and "I" positioning as described.
3. Choice 2 has cubes that form a straight "L" shape from top/down to bottom/right, which does not match.
4. Choice 3 also mismatches as the horizontal cubes are not separated as in the original image.
5. Choice 4 matches the configuration of the original image: the perpendicular "L" shape and the three projecting cubes.

Thus, the correctly rotated object is in:
