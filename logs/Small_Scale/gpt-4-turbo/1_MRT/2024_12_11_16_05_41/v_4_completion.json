Original Image Shape Analysis:\\n   - It features seven cuboids.\\n   - The configuration is a bent shape resembling the letters \\\"J\\\" and \\\"L\\\", with one vertical stack positioned at an angle relative to another two horizontal stacks.\\n\\n2. Choice 1 Analysis:\\n   - This option shows seven cuboids but arranged with an extra joint between two horizontal sections that is not angled similarly to the original. This does not match.\\n\\n3. Choice 2 Analysis:\\n   - Similar orientation to the original, but it appears inverted, like a mirrored version. It looks closely related but seems more like a mirror image, not a rotation.\\n\\n4. Choice 3 Analysis:\\n   - This choice clearly matches the structure and orientation of the original image: seven total cuboids with a similar bent configuration and an angular relationship between the sections.\\n\\n5. Choice 4 Analysis:\\n   - This option also shows seven cuboids, but the configuration now involves an overhanging cuboid that doesn't align with the original structure\u2019s form.\\n\\nAfter analyzing all choices, Choice 3 most accurately reflects a 3D rotation of the original object without altering its relative connectivity or layout.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 3\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733904381,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 289,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 1367,\n        \"total_tokens\": 1656,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
