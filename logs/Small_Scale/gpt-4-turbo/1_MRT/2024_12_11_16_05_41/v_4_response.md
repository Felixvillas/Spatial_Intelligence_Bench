To determine which image shows the same object rotated in 3D, we should carefully analyze the connectivity and orientation of the cuboids relative to each other in the initial object and compare them to the choices provided.

1. Original Image Shape Analysis:
   - It features seven cuboids.
   - The configuration is a bent shape resembling the letters "J" and "L", with one vertical stack positioned at an angle relative to another two horizontal stacks.

2. Choice 1 Analysis:
   - This option shows seven cuboids but arranged with an extra joint between two horizontal sections that is not angled similarly to the original. This does not match.

3. Choice 2 Analysis:
   - Similar orientation to the original, but it appears inverted, like a mirrored version. It looks closely related but seems more like a mirror image, not a rotation.

4. Choice 3 Analysis:
   - This choice clearly matches the structure and orientation of the original image: seven total cuboids with a similar bent configuration and an angular relationship between the sections.

5. Choice 4 Analysis:
   - This option also shows seven cuboids, but the configuration now involves an overhanging cuboid that doesn't align with the original structure¡¯s form.

After analyzing all choices, Choice 3 most accurately reflects a 3D rotation of the original object without altering its relative connectivity or layout.
