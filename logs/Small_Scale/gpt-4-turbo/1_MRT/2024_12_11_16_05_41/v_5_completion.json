It appears to lie on a different axis, and the segments seem to bend differently compared to the original image.\\n\\n4. **Choice 3**: This shape diverges significantly from the original with a different configuration, which doesn't match any rotation of the original image.\\n\\n5. **Choice 4**: This shape aligns closely with the original, showing a similar configuration where the perspective is rotated slightly to possibly show a more direct overhead view of the unrotated shape.\\n\\nBy comparing and analyzing the layout and visual orientation of each, Choice 1 and Choice 4 are possible candidates for matching the original image's rotated versions. However, determining between them requires considering subtle perspective differences.\\n\\n- **Choice 1** displays a matching configuration but rotated forward slightly.\\n- **Choice 4** shows more similarity in configuration but with a different (possibly overhead tilted) perspective. \\n\\nAnalyzing carefully, Choice 4 maintains more of the essential visual alignment and dimensionality of the original, including the connection between the blocks more accurately reflecting a simple perspective rotation without altering the spatial relationships significantly.\\n\\nHere's the answer in the requested format:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 4\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733904396,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 358,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 1367,\n        \"total_tokens\": 1725,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
