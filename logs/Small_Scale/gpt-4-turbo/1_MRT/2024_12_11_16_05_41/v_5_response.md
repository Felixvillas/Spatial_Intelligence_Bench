To solve this question, let's analyze the configuration of cubes in each choice compared to the configuration in the original image. 

1. **Original Shape**: The image shows a three-dimensional shape resembling an "L" form lying flat with three blocks long, two blocks up, and an additional two blocks long horizontally from the vertical portion.

2. **Choice 1**: This shape also forms an "L," resembling the original with one part appearing to have been rotated forward or the perspective changed horizontally.

3. **Choice 2**: This shape, while maintaining the "L" figure, is oriented differently. It appears to lie on a different axis, and the segments seem to bend differently compared to the original image.

4. **Choice 3**: This shape diverges significantly from the original with a different configuration, which doesn't match any rotation of the original image.

5. **Choice 4**: This shape aligns closely with the original, showing a similar configuration where the perspective is rotated slightly to possibly show a more direct overhead view of the unrotated shape.

By comparing and analyzing the layout and visual orientation of each, Choice 1 and Choice 4 are possible candidates for matching the original image's rotated versions. However, determining between them requires considering subtle perspective differences.

- **Choice 1** displays a matching configuration but rotated forward slightly.
- **Choice 4** shows more similarity in configuration but with a different (possibly overhead tilted) perspective. 

Analyzing carefully, Choice 4 maintains more of the essential visual alignment and dimensionality of the original, including the connection between the blocks more accurately reflecting a simple perspective rotation without altering the spatial relationships significantly.
