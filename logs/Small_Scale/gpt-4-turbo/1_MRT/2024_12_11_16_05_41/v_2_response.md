The original image shows a three-dimensional shape composed of cube-like segments arranged to form a distinct structure. We need to assess each choice by comparing its configuration to this structure while considering possible rotations in 3D space.

- **Choice 1:** The arrangement of the segments slightly differs. The vertical segment is in the front rather than on the side in the original image, suggesting a different orientation or shape.
  
- **Choice 2:** The arrangement here appears flat and more direct, with a different angle and perspective compared to the original shape.

- **Choice 3:** This choice closely matches the original arrangement with a reasonable assumption of a slight rotation, aligning segments in an equivalent structure.

- **Choice 4:** The layout and angle look similar to the original but appear flipped around a horizontal or vertical axis, not a simple 3D rotation from the given perspective.

Based on the analysis, the 3D shape in Choice 3 is the most likely match to the original when considering possible rotations, so the response would be:
