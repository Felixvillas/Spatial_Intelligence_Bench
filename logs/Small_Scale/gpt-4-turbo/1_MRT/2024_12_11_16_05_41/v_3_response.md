Analyzing the shape in each image:

**Original Shape**: L-shaped with a short base (5 cubes: 3 horizontal followed by a bend of 2 vertical) and a longer upright section (4 cubes: 3 vertical followed by 1 horizontal on top).

**Choice 1**:
- Quick inspection and mentally rotating it, it maintains the structure of the original L-shape with the longer section slightly bent out.

**Choice 2**:
- The arrangement differs significantly; the junction between sections is altered, creating an impossibility to be the same object, as it creates a T-shaped end which doesn't match.

**Choice 3**:
- This options shows a similar overall structure as the base shape but appears to bend in a manner that doesn't correspond with the original orientation capabilities.

**Choice 4**:
- This choice also shows significant structural rearrangement which does not correspond to simple 3D rotation of the original shape.

Considering the best match with the least structural discrepancies when mentally rotated:
Choice 1 seems the most plausible as a rotated version of the original shape.
