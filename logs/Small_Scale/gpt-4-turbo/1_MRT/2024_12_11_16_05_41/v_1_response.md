To determine which of the choices show the same object rotated in 3D, we need to analyze the arrangement and connection of blocks in each option and match them to the original image.

### Analysis:
1. **Original Image**:
   - A long section composed of four cubes.
   - A short section connected in a perpendicular manner with two cubes following the main section.
   - Another two-cube section extending from the second cube in the main long section in another perpendicular direction.

2. **Choice 1**:
   - Consists of sections that align with the original description when rotated.
   - The arrangement and connections are identical, just viewed from a different angle.

3. **Choice 2**:
   - The structure has a difference in cube arrangement and the connective direction of some sections, not matching the original.

4. **Choice 3**:
   - Lacks the perpendicular two-cube section from the second cube, and overall connection of cubes does not match.

5. **Choice 4**:
   - The two-cube section extends from the third cube in the main section, which is incorrect when compared to the original structure.

### Conclusion:
Only **Choice 1** has a structure that can be obtained by rotating the original structure in 3D space, without changing the connection points or order of cubes.
