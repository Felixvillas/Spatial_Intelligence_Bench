The relative positions of the cubes and their connecting angles match the original structure.\\n\\n- **Choice 2:** This choice shows a top-down view where the cubes are arranged differently from the original depiction, presenting a continuous \\\"Z\\\" shape which does not match the original spatial orientation.\\n\\n- **Choice 3:** Displays a similar form as the original, but the vertical alignment of the cubes in the original image makes it a non-match. This view is too frontal compared to the given original image.\\n\\n- **Choice 4:** The rotation and angles between the segments of cubes differ significantly from those in the original image. The bottom segment extends out which is not consistent with the arrangement in the original.\\n\\nAnalyzing the orientation and placement of the cubes, Choice 1 maintains the same structural form but viewed at a different angle, matching the original shape properly:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 1\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733904578,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 259,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 1367,\n        \"total_tokens\": 1626,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
