To determine which choice shows the same 3D object as the initial image but rotated, let¡¯s compare the structure in each option:

1. **Original Image:** The shape resembles a zig-zag or staircase in 3D, with three blocks forming a vertical line followed by two blocks extending horizontally forming an 'L' shape.

2. **Choice 1:** This shape has the same configuration of the vertical set of three blocks and subsequent two blocks horizontally, maintaining the same 'L' shape orientation. This appears to match the orientation of the original image.
  
3. **Choice 2:** This appears to show a different structure where in the third set of cubes extends downwards making it different from the original's 'L' shape.

4. **Choice 3:** The vertical segment consists of four blocks, which clearly differs from the original configuration of three blocks.

5. **Choice 4:** This shape also differs in the orientation and the continuity of blocks, not matching the expected pattern from the original image's 'L' shape that maintains the vertical to horizontal connection.

Based on this analysis, only **Choice 1** maintains the same pattern as the original image, suggesting it is simply a rotated view, and not altered in shape configuration. The JSON response would be:
