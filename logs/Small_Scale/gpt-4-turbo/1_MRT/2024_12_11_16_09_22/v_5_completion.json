This appears to match the orientation of the original image.\\n  \\n3. **Choice 2:** This appears to show a different structure where in the third set of cubes extends downwards making it different from the original's 'L' shape.\\n\\n4. **Choice 3:** The vertical segment consists of four blocks, which clearly differs from the original configuration of three blocks.\\n\\n5. **Choice 4:** This shape also differs in the orientation and the continuity of blocks, not matching the expected pattern from the original image's 'L' shape that maintains the vertical to horizontal connection.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, only **Choice 1** maintains the same pattern as the original image, suggesting it is simply a rotated view, and not altered in shape configuration.
