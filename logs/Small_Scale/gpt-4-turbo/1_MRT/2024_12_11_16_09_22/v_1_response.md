To determine which choice shows the same three-dimensional object rotated in 3D, we must consider the arrangement and relative positions of the cubes in each option compared to the original image.

Original Image: 
- Horizontal section consisting of three cubes, extending to another horizontal section of four cubes.
- A vertical section protrudes downward from the junction of the three and four cube sections.

Now, examining each choice:

1. Choice 1: 
   - Horizontal section of three cubes connecting to a second horizontal section of four cubes, with a vertical downward section. This closely matches the configuration of the original image.

2. Choice 2:
   - This configuration has cubes at angles and does not maintain a simple horizontal and vertical pattern as seen in the original image.

3. Choice 3:
   - In this image, the section consists of five continuous cubes bent at an angle with a projection similar to a two-cube section. This does not match the original configuration.

4. Choice 4:
   - This shows a vertical tall section connected via a corner to a horizontal L-shaped section, which doesn't match the original configuration.

From this assessment, Choice 1 best matches the original object but as a rotated view in 3D.
