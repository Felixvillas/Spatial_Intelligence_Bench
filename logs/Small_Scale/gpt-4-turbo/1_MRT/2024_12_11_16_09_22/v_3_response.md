Analyzing the given images of the three-dimensional shape, each consisting of cubes arranged in specific configurations, requires identifying shifts or rotations without structural changes.

- The original image shows a shape resembling a bent arm with seven cubes: four in the first segment and three in the bent segment.

- Choice 1: The shape here appears similar in configuration but is viewed from another angle, showing the same two segments distinctively.
- Choice 2: The configuration in this image differs significantly - particularly, the arrangement and connections of the cubes do not match those in the original.
- Choice 3: The configuration also differs notably from the original, with a reversed arrangement.
- Choice 4: The layout of the cubes here also does not follow the original configuration.

After comparing each choice:

Choice 1 maintains the same structural arrangement and simply appears rotated or viewed from a different perspective. The other choices exhibit changes in how the cubes are linked, representing different configurations from the original.
