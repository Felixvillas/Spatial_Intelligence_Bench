The provided image shows a three-dimensional shape consisting of 7 cubes forming what looks like a bent "T" shape. This formation is typically known as a polyomino in geometric terms, particularly in puzzle pieces like tetris.

Let's examine the choices relative to the original image to see which one could be the same shape simply rotated:

1. **Choice 1:** This choice also looks like a bent "T," but unlike the original, the orientation and connections between the cubes seem different. The stem of the "T" in Choice 1 is angled differently compared to the original.

2. **Choice 2:** This choice looks very similar to the original image in terms of the connections between the cubes, but like an exact match except rotated to give a more horizontal view from the top.

3. **Choice 3:** This choice resembles the original closely, as it maintains the "T" shape with correct angles and connections, although it seems to look at the shape from another different angle.

4. **Choice 4:** Here, the shape is angled differently again. The connection between the cubes suggests a different orientation that does not match the original image's configuration.

Considering these observations:

- **Choice 2** displays identical connectivity and a consistent number count as seen in the original image, but simply viewed from a rotated perspective that aligns with natural 3D rotation possibilities. 

Thus, my conclusion is:
