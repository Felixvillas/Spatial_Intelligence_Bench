Choice 1: \\n   - Horizontal section of three cubes connecting to a second horizontal section of four cubes, with a vertical downward section. This closely matches the configuration of the original image.\\n\\n2. Choice 2:\\n   - This configuration has cubes at angles and does not maintain a simple horizontal and vertical pattern as seen in the original image.\\n\\n3. Choice 3:\\n   - In this image, the section consists of five continuous cubes bent at an angle with a projection similar to a two-cube section. This does not match the original configuration.\\n\\n4. Choice 4:\\n   - This shows a vertical tall section connected via a corner to a horizontal L-shaped section, which doesn't match the original configuration.\\n\\nFrom this assessment, Choice 1 best matches the original object but as a rotated view in 3D. \\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 1\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733904567,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 263,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 1367,\n        \"total_tokens\": 1630,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
