Analyzing each choice step-by-step for representing the original shape rotated in 3D:

- **Original Shape Description**: The shape appears to consist of 7 blocks forming an uppercase letter 'L' with an extended top. Specifically, it forms a 3-block vertical column on the left connected to a 4-block horizontal row at the bottom.

- **Choice 1**: The shape shown closely resembles the original shape but from a slightly different angle or perspective, maintaining the same 'L' structure with an extended top.

- **Choice 2**: The shape depicted seems to maintain the general layout of the original shape but appears rotated to provide a different perspective with some visual overlap of cubes.

- **Choice 3**: This shape maintains a similar 'L' structure but appears as if it rotates about a different axis, showing a more straightened appearance than the original complicated 'L' structure.

- **Choice 4**: The image shows a similar arrangement to the original but tilted backward or seen from below, creating a slight variation in perspective rather than a noticeable rotation that changes cube positions relative to each other.

Based on these observations, Choice 2 is the one that resembles a true rotation of the original shape in 3D, with changes in the visible arrangement of the cubes while maintaining the fundamental 'L' form.
