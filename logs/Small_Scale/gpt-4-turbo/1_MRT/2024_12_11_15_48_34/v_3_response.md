Analyzing the geometry of the initial three-dimensional shape, I notice it has two perpendicular lines (one vertical and one horizontal) forming an angle, with three cubes in the vertical line and four in the horizontal line plus an extra cube sticking out vertically at one far end.

Let's inspect the available choices:

1. **Choice 1**: The structure features an extra tilt and perspective, but the cube sequence and arrangement are incorrect compared to the problem description. It does not match precisely as the placement of the protruding cube is not consistent with the original orientation.
   
2. **Choice 2**: This representation shows the right angles and cube positions with the three vertical blocks and the topmost vertical block on the far left, aligning with the shape characteristics of the initial image.
   
3. **Choice 3**: The angles and the sequence of the cubes here do not match the initial configuration. The cubes do not align as per the provided description.

4. **Choice 4**: This choice shifts the orientation, but it fails to match the original configuration in terms of exact cube placement and angles.

Based on the details observed, Choice 2 correctly represents the same object rotated in 3D.
