The initial image presents a three-dimensional L-shaped configuration made from cuboids. To determine which choice represents the same object merely rotated, we need to align the components visually:

1. **Choice 1**: This appears to be the same L-shaped configuration as the initial image but viewed from a different angle. The relative placements of the segments in the shape correspond correctly.

2. **Choice 2**: The configuration in this image includes a vertical segment intersecting another segment in an angled way, which does not match the straight L-shape seen in the initial image.

3. **Choice 3**: In this choice, while there are similarities, the intersection and orientation of the segments differ from those observed in the initial image.

4. **Choice 4**: This image clearly shows a different orientation and placement of the segments. The vertical and horizontal alignment does not match the original form shown.

After reviewing each option:
- **Choice 1** matches the alignment and rotation of the blocks in the original image with the correct geometric consistency.
