The original image shows a three-dimensional shape with a distinct configuration of cubes. To determine which choice shows the same object rotated, we need to observe the orientation and connection of the cubes in each choice compared to the original image.

- **Choice 1**: The arrangement and angles of cubes are slightly different, notably the bend in the structure.
- **Choice 2**: The arrangement looks more linear and lacks the overhead projection of a cube as seen in the original image.
- **Choice 3**: This choice closely matches the original with the correct orientation of cubes aligned similarly when rotated.
- **Choice 4**: The arrangement does appear similar but the orientation of some cubes is not consistent with the original structure.
