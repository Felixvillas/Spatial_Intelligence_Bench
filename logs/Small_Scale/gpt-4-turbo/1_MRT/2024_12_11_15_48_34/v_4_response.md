Upon analyzing the four choices relative to the original image, here's a step-by-step breakdown of observations:

1. **Original Shape**: The shape appears to be composed of six cubes, forming two L-shaped configurations connected along a vertical and horizontal axis.

2. **Choice 1**: This option shows two L-shaped configurations connected in a somewhat perpendicular form. The spatial orientation differs significantly from the original shape, which does not feature such a pronounced perpendicular connection.

3. **Choice 2**: This choice displays both L-shaped structures connected in a more rounded angle but maintains a similar configuration to the original shape. The perceived connectivity area and structure are close, making this option potentially correct.

4. **Choice 3**: The overall configuration of the cubes is similar to the original; the two L-shapes look connected by their corner in a way reminiscent of the original shape's orientation.

5. **Choice 4**: Here, the two L-shaped structures connect in a different way, where one part appears elevated, which distorts the simple connection observed in the original shape.

Considering the shapes carefully, the arrangement that most closely resembles the original in three-dimensional space, maintaining the correct connection and layout, is found in:
