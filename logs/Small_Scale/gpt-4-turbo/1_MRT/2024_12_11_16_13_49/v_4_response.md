To determine which image shows the same object rotated in 3D, we need to analyze the configuration and orientation of the shape in each option compared to the original image.

1. **Original Image**: It shows a configuration resembling an "L" shape, comprised of 7 cubic parts arranged in a specific layout.

2. **Choice 1**: This configuration differs as it shows a somewhat flat lying "Z" shape, with the blocks touching in different manners than in the original.

3. **Choice 2**: This choice shows a "V" shaped configuration with an inward connection, differing from the original's outward connection.

4. **Choice 3**: This image presents a similar shape to that in the original image but rotated. Both maintain the same "L" configuration but viewed from a slightly different angle.

5. **Choice 4**: This configuration appears modified, resembling an "A" or "n" shape, which is not simply a rotation but a different alignment from the original image.

Analyzing the shapes, **Choice 3** appears as the same shape only rotated, thus maintaining the continuity and connection of blocks as seen in the original image.
