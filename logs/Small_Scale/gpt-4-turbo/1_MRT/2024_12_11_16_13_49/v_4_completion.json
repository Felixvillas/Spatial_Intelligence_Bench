Both maintain the same \\\"L\\\" configuration but viewed from a slightly different angle.\\n\\n5. **Choice 4**: This configuration appears modified, resembling an \\\"A\\\" or \\\"n\\\" shape, which is not simply a rotation but a different alignment from the original image.\\n\\nAnalyzing the shapes, **Choice 3** appears as the same shape only rotated, thus maintaining the continuity and connection of blocks as seen in the original image.\\n\\n```\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 3\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733904867,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 247,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 1367,\n        \"total_tokens\": 1614,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
