The first segment at the bottom is a horizontal arrangement of 4 blocks. The second segment in the middle extends upward from the second block of the bottom segment and consists of 3 blocks. The third segment at the top extends horizontally from the top of the middle segment containing 3 blocks.\\n\\nAnalyzing the choice images:\\n\\n1. **Choice 1**: The segments are matching in terms of arrangement and orientation with the original image, but it appears as a different rotation or perspective.\\n   \\n2. **Choice 2**: This choice fails to match because the third segment is directly above the middle segment, unlike the zigzag arrangement in the original where the third segment is offset horizontally.\\n\\n3. **Choice 3**: The alignment and the count of blocks in each segment appear to match the original. The perspective is different, showing a possible 3D rotation from the original view.\\n   \\n4. **Choice 4**: Incorrect since the last segment is positioned differently compared to the original image.\\n\\nAmong these, only Choice 3 captures the same configuration and orientation of blocks from a different perspective, appearing merely as a 3D rotation of the original object.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 3\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733904843,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 285,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 1367,\n        \"total_tokens\": 1652,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
