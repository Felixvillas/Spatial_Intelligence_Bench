To determine which of the images shows the same object rotated in 3D, observe the structure of the cube formation in each choice relative to the original image. 

- In the original image, the structure shows 5 vertical cubes on the left side and 3 horizontal cubes on the right side extending upward with 2 overlapping cubes.
- Looking at Choice 1, the orientation and positioning of the cubes match the original image, indicating it is likely a rotated view of the same object.
- Choices 2, 3, and 4 have different arrangements and connectivity of cubes that do not match the construction observed in the original image.

Thus, the rotated version of the original object is visible in:
