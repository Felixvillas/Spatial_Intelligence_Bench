To determine which image represents the same three-dimensional shape as the original but rotated in space, we need to analyze the configurations and orientations of the blocks in each choice.

**Original shape**:
- The shape is an "L" like configuration with total 10 blocks divided as 7 on the elongated side and 3 forming a shorter side perpendicular at the end of the 7 blocks.

**Analysis**:
- **Choice 1**: The arrangement appears to be an "angled Z" configuration with 7 blocks along the main body and 3 along the raised section. The orientation and intersection angles differ from the original.
  
- **Choice 2**: Here the shorter side with 3 blocks appears to be above the longer line of 7 blocks. It forms a sort of rotated "U" or hook shape, which doesn't match the original shape.

- **Choice 3**: This shape resembles an "angled N" configuration, where the 7 blocks are angled downward connecting to the 3 blocks at a different angle, not matching the original.

- **Choice 4**: Observing the configuration, it aligns with the original "L" shaped design but looks like it has been rotated to lean backward relative to the viewer. This maintains the perpendicular junction of the 7 and 3 blocks correctly, matching the original.

From this analysis, **Choice 4** matches the orientation and block configuration of the original shape when considering possible rotations in 3D space.
