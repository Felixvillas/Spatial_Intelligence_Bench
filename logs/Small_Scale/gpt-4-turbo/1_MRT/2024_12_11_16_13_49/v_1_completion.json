The L-shaped blocks and their connections are in the same orientation, just viewed from a different perspective.\\n\\n2. **Choice 2** has a different configuration where some blocks appear to be overlapping or structured differently compared to the original image.\\n\\n3. **Choice 3** shows a misaligned arrangement compared to the original shape. Here, the blocks are not matching in the way they connect.\\n\\n4. **Choice 4** displays a different perspective where some blocks do not match how they connect in the original shape.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, Choice 1 is the image that shows the same object rotated in 3D relative to the original image.\\n\\n```\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 1\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733904833,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 186,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 1367,\n        \"total_tokens\": 1553,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
