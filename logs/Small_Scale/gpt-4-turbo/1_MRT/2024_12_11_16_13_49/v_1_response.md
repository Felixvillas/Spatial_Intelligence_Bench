To determine which image shows the same three-dimensional shape but rotated in 3D, let's analyze each choice:

1. **Choice 1** seems to match the original shape configuration with a similar angle and piece arrangement. The L-shaped blocks and their connections are in the same orientation, just viewed from a different perspective.

2. **Choice 2** has a different configuration where some blocks appear to be overlapping or structured differently compared to the original image.

3. **Choice 3** shows a misaligned arrangement compared to the original shape. Here, the blocks are not matching in the way they connect.

4. **Choice 4** displays a different perspective where some blocks do not match how they connect in the original shape.

From this analysis, Choice 1 is the image that shows the same object rotated in 3D relative to the original image.
