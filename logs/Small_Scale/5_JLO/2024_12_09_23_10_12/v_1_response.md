To solve this problem, let's analyze the provided images step by step:

1. **Identify the Angle in the Original Image**:
   - We observe that there are two lines in the first image. One line is more vertical and the other is more slanted to the right.

2. **Use the Reference Lines**:
   - The reference lines image is numbered from 1 to 11, with line 1 being horizontal and line 6 being vertical. 
   - We need to find pairs that resemble the angle formed in the original image.

3. **Comparison with the Options**:
   - **Option 1: Lines 1 and 4** - This forms an acute angle, similar to a small rightward angle.
   - **Option 2: Lines 1 and 3** - This would also form a smaller angle.
   - **Option 3: Lines 1 and 2** - This seems to form a very acute angle.
   - **Option 4: Lines 1 and 8** - Line 8 is more slanted than line 4, forming a medium-sized angle with line 1.

4. **Select the Best Match**:
   - To match the original lines' positions, the angle seems closest to a middle range, rather than an extremely acute or wide angle.
   - Option 1's (Lines 1 and 4) orientation fits better here, as it represents a moderate angle.

Therefore, the angle between the lines in the original image seems best represented by Option 1.
