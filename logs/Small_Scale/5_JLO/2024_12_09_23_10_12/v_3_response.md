To find the angle between the two lines in the first image using the reference lines in the second image, follow these steps:

1. **Observe the Angle**: Look at the orientation of the two given lines in the first image, noting the approximate angle between them.

2. **Compare with Reference**: Compare this angle with the reference set of lines in the second image. Identify which pair of lines the angle most closely resembles.

3. **Identify Matching Pair**:
   - Lines 1 and 9: Wider angle.
   - Lines 1 and 7: Moderately wide angle.
   - Lines 1 and 3: Narrow angle.
   - Lines 1 and 6: Moderate angle.

   Upon visual inspection, the angle in the first image appears to match the angle formed by lines 1 and 6.

4. **Finalize the Answer**: Based on the observation, the angle in the first image aligns most closely with lines 1 and 6.
