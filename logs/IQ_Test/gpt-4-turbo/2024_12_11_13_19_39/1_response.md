Analyzing the given block image, which is composed of multiple smaller blocks organized into specific shapes, we can determine the missing piece by comparing the options:

1. Choice 1 is a group of six blocks with a missing corner along the top layer. This doesn't seem present in the disassembled shown pieces.
2. Choice 2 forms a shape of six blocks similar to Choice 1, just mirrored. It's also not visible among the pieces.
3. Choice 3 consists of six blocks placed in a stair-stepping format that decreases by one block each layer. This shape is visible in the disassembled pieces.
4. Choice 4 has six blocks with three on the bottom layer and three stacked directly on top of part of the first layer. This configuration matches with one of the disassembled pieces given.
5. Choice 5 features five blocks in an 'L' shape, with four on the bottom layer and one stacked on top. This configuration is also represented in the disassembled pieces.

From this, we can deduce which piece doesn't appear among the disassembled shown pieces:
