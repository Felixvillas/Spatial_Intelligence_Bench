To determine which image is next in the sequence, I'll analyze the changes in the structures between each consecutive pair in the sequence:

1. From the first to the second image, the upper section moves to the right and slightly downwards. The lower left section elongates, forming a right protrusion.
2. From the second to the third image, the upper section moves slightly further right. The right protrusion remains, and a new bottom right vertical block is added.

Comparing these changes with the five choices provided, the pattern seems to involve the continuous rightward movement of the upper section and changes in the details of the lower sections.

Looking at the choices:
- Choice 1 has an upper section that moves further to the right but introduces an upper-left vertical block not present in the previous piece.
- Choice 2 shows a more connected structure, where the upper section appears somewhat consistent with previous shifts, and the lower right vertical section remains with less elongation than in other choices.
- Choice 3 maintains the upper section's extension to the right, but the bottom right block doesn't extend as much as choice 2.
- Choice 4 also continues the rightward progression and has an elongation similar to the earlier patterns but appears to extend further downwards.
- Choice 5 matches the traits seen in choice 4 but also introduces a disconnected appearance in the lower part which hasn't appeared in the sequence yet.

Based on these observations, assessing connectivity and the extension patterns of both upper and lower sections, Choice 2 seems to best follow the progression of the sequence without introducing uncharacteristic elements.
