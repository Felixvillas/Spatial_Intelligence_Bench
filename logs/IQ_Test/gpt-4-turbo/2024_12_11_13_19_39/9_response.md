Upon examining the pattern of the original image and how the dotted lines indicate where the folds will occur, it becomes clear that the resulting image would be symmetrical along the folded dotted lines. By observing how the shapes and colors are represented in each choice compared to the folded outcome:

1. The central area, where no lines are present, should ideally be plain in the resulting folded state.
2. The bordering areas transformed via the folds should produce a repeated and symmetrical pattern, following the blueprint and collision of shapes through the folding of corners towards the center.

Assessing all the given choices:

- **Choice 1:** Shows a mix of designs and colors not completely aligning with the directed folding symmetry.
- **Choice 2:** Similar to Choice 1, the designs here either add too much or misplace some elements expected from the folding.
- **Choice 3:** Also presents unclear symmetry and mismatches in folding orientations.
- **Choice 4:** Appears to more closely match the possible outcomes of the fold, presenting a clean square center with extended lines symmetrically distributed as per the fold guides.
- **Choice 5:** Displays a clear central area like Choice 4, but the designs are slightly off, failing to truly mimic the realistic outcome of such a fold.

Based on these observations, **Choice 4** demonstrates the closest expected outcome when the sheet is folded along the dotted lines, aligning neatly and symmetrically as per the initial dotted guide.
