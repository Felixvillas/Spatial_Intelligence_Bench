The sequence depicts a pattern where each image presents an arrangement of blocks representing numbers. It appears that a possible way to identify what each block represents is through its reflection or rotation. Following the pattern observed:

1. The first image shows the number "2".
2. The second image seems to represent the number "1".
3. The third image depicts the number "0".

The logical continuation of these numbers in sequence could be the number "9". Among the choices given:
- Choice 1 represents the number "1".
- Choice 2 represents "4".
- Choice 3 looks like "7".
- Choice 4 could be the number "4".
- Choice 5 appears to be the number "9". 

Based on this deduction, Choice 5 correctly fits as the number "9" and is the continuation of the sequence.
