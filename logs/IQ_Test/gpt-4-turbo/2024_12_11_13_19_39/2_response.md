To determine the resulting shape from folding the original shape along the dotted line, let's analyze the properties:

The original image depicts a quadrilateral (a four-sided polygon), specifically a parallelogram. When folded along the diagonal dotted line, which runs from one corner of the parallelogram to the opposite corner, each part that is being folded over will align exactly onto the other, forming a new shape. They match exactly because the line of folding is along a diagonal that bisects the parallelogram.

Among the choices provided:
- Choice 1 is a parallelogram.
- Choice 2 is a rectangle.
- Choice 3 forms a 'V' shape.
- Choice 4 is a triangle.
- Choice 5 remains a parallelogram but rotated in relation to Choice 1.

Considering how parallelograms behave, the correct fold along the diagonal will result in a triangular shape, with each half of the parallelogram laying perfectly over the other along one of their respective longer sides. Thus, the new shape, being a result of a perfect fold along a diagonal, forms half of the original parallelogram with all sides aligning perfectly. This shape is represented in Choice 4, a triangle.
