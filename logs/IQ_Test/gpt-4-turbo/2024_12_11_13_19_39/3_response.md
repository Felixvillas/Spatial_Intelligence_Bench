We start by analyzing the visible faces of the four pieces:
1. The first piece has gray, yellow, and blue faces.
2. The second piece has gray, blue, and additional blue faces.
3. The third piece has yellow, blue, and green faces.
4. The fourth piece has gray, green, and more green faces.

Next, we need to check each choice and see if they comply with the arrangement of these faces:

- **Choice 1**: Presents faces gray, green, blue, yellow, but no visible piece matches having both yellow and green faces directly connected.
- **Choice 2**: Presents faces gray, green, blue, and yellow, and matches with the visible sides of the first and third pieces, aligning in plausible positions.
- **Choice 3**: Presents the same set of visible faces as choice 2, but with differing spatial configuration. It's feasible as the colors on the visible faces match the blocks' visible colors and their configurations.
- **Choice 4**: Presents two adjacent blue faces, which is only possible with the second piece and no other piece has blue faces only.
- **Choice 5**: Presents faces gray, green, blue, yellow, and also has two blue faces that are not adjacent, which doesn¡¯t match with our second piece's configuration.

The possible options based on the configuration of pieces and visible colored faces in choices are either Choice 2 or Choice 3. However, choice 2 seems unlikely due to incorrect positioning of blue and green near each other. Choice 3 presents a more realistic placement matching all the visible color faces and their alignment based on the puzzle pieces.

So the answer in the requested format is:
