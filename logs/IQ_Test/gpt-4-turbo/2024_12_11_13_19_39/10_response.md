The given image shows step-by-step the folding of a shape starting with a triangle, which is then successively folded following the dotted lines. Visualizing these steps:

1. The first dotted line in the triangle indicates the fold that creates a smaller triangle. This process essentially matches what is shown in step 2.
2. In the next step, another internal part of the resulting triangle is folded inward along the dotted line, which is again perfectly depicted by step 3.
3. To identify the final shape from the choices given, it needs to align precisely with how the shapes have been folded along the dotted lines in the image.

Looking at the choices:
- Choice 3 most accurately shows the ultimate configuration of the folds based on the directions indicated by the dotted lines.

The sequence of the lines and the final positioning in Choice 3 is a spot-on result of the described folding process. 

Therefore, the correct choice is:

```
