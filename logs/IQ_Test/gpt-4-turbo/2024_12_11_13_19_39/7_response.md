To determine the next image in the sequence, let's look at the orientation and visible colors of each side of the cubes in the sequence.

1. In the first cube, the visible sides show: red and yellow on top, blue on the right, and two gray squares at the bottom.
2. The second cube shows: yellow on top, blue on the right, and two gray squares at the bottom.
3. The third cube shows: yellow on top, a red stripe next to a yellow stripe on the right, and two gray squares at the bottom.

The transition from the first to the third cube involves rotations and changes in visibility of colors. The yellow color becomes dominant on the top side, and the third cube introduces a mix of red and yellow on the right side.

Now let's analyze the choices based on the given pattern:
- For the next cube, we would likely need the transition that keeps yellow on top, while perhaps introducing some change on the right side as suggested by the progression.

Evaluating each choice among the options:
- Choice 1 shows two yellow squares and some red on the top, blue right, similar gray squares alignment.
- Choice 2 has incorrect color dominance on top (includes green) and a mix of two colors on the right side.
- Choice 3 shows continuity in the yellow on top with added blue, but the right side is not pattern-consistent.
- Choice 4 introduces green on the top, which hasn't appeared in any of the sequence cubes' top sides.
- Choice 5 like choice 1, has yellow and some red on top, blue right side, but includes a green square which is inconsistent.

By examining the options, Choice 1 stands out as the most consistent next step in the sequence due to its resemblance in the arrangements of yellow and blue and maintaining the gray alignment. Thus, the following JSON response is concluded:
