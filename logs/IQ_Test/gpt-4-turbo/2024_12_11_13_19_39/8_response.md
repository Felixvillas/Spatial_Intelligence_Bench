The task is to find the 3-D shape that corresponds to the provided 2-D representations. Each 2-D representation involves a top view, a front view, and a side view.

Analyzing the 2-D layouts:

1. The first shape is tall, with a peak that tapers and a base that extends forward and back.
2. The middle shape appears to have a straight vertical profile.
3. The third shape is again a vertical structure with a sloping shoulder on one side and a base extending backward.

Evaluating the 3-D model choices:

- **Choice 1** shows a peak with both the top part and the base extending downward.
- **Choice 2** lacks the extended front projection seen in the second 2-D diagram.
- **Choice 3** matches closely with all three views. The peak aligns with the first diagram, the rectangular broad side aligns with the third diagram, and the straight side aligns with the middle diagram.
- **Choice 4** has correct side projections but the base in the 2-D views doesn't align perfectly with this model.
- **Choice 5** shows a similar peak, but the base extends in a direction not supported by the side view in the 2-D diagrams.

Analyzing closely, **Choice 3** meets all the criteria set by the 2-D representations.
