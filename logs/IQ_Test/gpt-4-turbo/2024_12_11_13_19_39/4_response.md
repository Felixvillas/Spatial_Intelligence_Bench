To identify the next image in the sequence, let's analyze the patterns observed step by step:

1. **Observing the Sequence:**
   - First image: A hexagon-like shape with the top half divided into a red trapezoid and a yellow triangle, and the bottom half is a single large yellow triangle.
   - Second image: A simplified version with a red trapezoid bisected by a yellow triangle from the base.
   - Third image: Similar to the second, but the red trapezoid swapped with the yellow triangle.

2. **Breaking Down the Transformations:**
   - From the first to the second image, the large yellow triangle from the bottom disappears, and the arrangement condenses into a tighter geometric representation.
   - From the second to the third image, the colors continue in the same positions but are flipped vertically.

3. **Establishing a Pattern:**
   - The images are simplifying from the original while retaining the basic color blocks of red and yellow.
   - Each step reduces complexity and changes the orientation of the colors within the shared boundaries.

4. **Evaluating Choices:**
   - **Choice 1**: Further simplification similar to image two, but the white space within the shape might not follow the simplifying pattern exactly.
   - **Choice 2**: Outward expansion and rotation of the same shapes from third image, but introduces a new structure instead of simplification.
   - **Choice 3**: Adds complexity with a new division not seen in previous parts of the sequence.
   - **Choice 4**: Similar to third, but entirely red, which deviates from alternating color pattern.
   - **Choice 5**: Appears as another simplification with a rotation aspect, fitting the sequential changes and maintaining the color alternation and complexity reduction.

Given these analyses, we focus on the consistent reduction of complexity and retention of color patterns, leading to our choice.
