Here is the breakdown by analyzing each side and its colors:\\n\\n1. **First piece**: Has yellow and gray sides with a corner where the two colors meet.\\n2. **Second piece**: Has blue and gray sides with a corner where these two colors meet.\\n3. **Third piece**: Has yellow and green sides.\\n4. **Fourth piece**: Has blue and green sides.\\n\\nNow, let's match these with the completed cubes:\\n\\n- **Choice 1**: Features green, yellow, and gray sides at the top visible face; blue and yellow on right visible face.\\n- **Choice 2**: Top has green, blue, and gray; right visible face has yellow and blue.\\n- **Choice 3**: Correct arrangement of the green and yellow sides beside each other on the top and blue, yellow, and gray exactly matching the pieces' distribution.\\n- **Choice 4**: Has blue, yellow patterns but does not match with the green side correctly.\\n- **Choice 5**: Does not align with the provided green and blue sides.\\n\\nFrom this analysis, the colors and arrangements in Choice 3 match exactly with the colors visible and their arrangement in the cube pieces provided.
