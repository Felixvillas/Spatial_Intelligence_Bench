To determine which image is next in the sequence, we need to observe the transformations or pattern progressions of the figures.

1. The first shape is oriented with one section extending vertically and another extending downward.
2. The second shape rotates slightly clockwise such that the same sections now appear somewhat diagonal and horizontal.
3. The third shape rotates further clockwise with clearer horizontal and diagonal sections.

The pattern appears to rely on the rotation of the shapes. Therefore, predicting the next in sequence would logically follow the continuation of this clockwise rotation.

Upon reviewing choice images:
- Choice 1 shows an extended diagonal form but doesn't align with the continued clockwise rotation.
- Choice 2 depicts a structure that doesn't rotate further from the pattern in the third image.
- Choice 3 shows a rotation but the layout isn¡¯t consistent with the previous shapes.
- Choice 4 almost returns to the form like the first image, incorrect due to lack of added rotation.
- Choice 5 shows a correct further rotation based on the previous image, maintaining relation and alignment properly.

Therefore, choice 5 is the next in sequence.
