To find the missing piece, we need to examine the provided blocks and determine which configuration can fit into the first multi-colored cube without duplicating any existing structures while leaving no gaps uncovered. Here¡¯s a dissection approach:

1. Analyzing the first multi-colored cube, it consists of several smaller cube units arranged in different configurations. The highlighted pink cube seems to suggest one unit of a larger piece that fits this color.

2. Now, we examine each choice to see how they could possibly fit into the pattern of the purple-pink unit configuration in the deeply colored portion of the 3D model:
  - **Choice 1** represents a three-dimensional arrangement with one cube at the base and above it two further cubes extending over the sides.
  - **Choice 2** has a similar arrangement to Choice 1 but slightly different in layout where it livels up on one side.
  - **Choice 3** shows a linear arrangement that isn¡¯t visually apparent in the multi-colored cube.
  - **Choice 4** again resembles Choice 1 but has a compact three-cube base and a three-cube upper level.
  - **Choice 5** has a primary base with two cubes and one additional cube on the top at a different position.

3. Visually fitting each choice:
   - Choices 1, 2, and 4 have structures that already exist in different sections of the model design.
   - Choice 5 has a structure that stands out visually not entirely matching any purple block configuration in the primary image.
   - Choice 3 has a unique structure that matches a potential space in the multi-colored structure where the purple-pink pattern exists, fitting seamlessly without overlapping with other pieces.

From the visual comparison and understanding of fitting the puzzle, it seems that Choice 3 would be the most suitable piece that, if removed, would leave a gap corresponding to its structure in the cube.
