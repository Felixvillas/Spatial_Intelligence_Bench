Analyzing the options that fit these criteria and the provided sequence, the most fitting would be the zigzag-like shapes made of six cubes. Choice 4 mirrors this pattern and follows a logical progression in continuity and complexity.\\n\\nLet's formulate the answer in the requested JSON format:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 4\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733894775,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 389,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 1619,\n        \"total_tokens\": 2008,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
