Analyzing the 2-D representations shown, each has a front face with a bottom step-like feature, indicating a portion projecting forward at the base. Carefully inspecting all choices reveals the need to match the step-like feature accurately in the 3-dimensional context. To systematically determine the correct 3-D shape:

- Choice 1 has a step that projects outward at the base, but it involves an overhanging portion which does not match the 2-D view as the top face extrudes beyond the step.
- Choice 2 features a step that projects outward and retracts inward, matching closely with the 2-D representation where the bottom extends and then steps back under the main body perfectly.
- Choice 3 also has a step that projects outward and partially matches the 2-D shape, however, the step extends wider than the base of the upright portion, which does not correlate precisely with the plain, direct impression of the 2-D sketches.
- Choice 4 has cohesive aspects like Choice 1 but also overhangs which do not match strictly.
- Choice 5, similar to Choice 2, presents a near match, but closely reviewing details of the 2-D depiction favors Choice 2 due to precise alignment with the step's recession under the main body.

Therefore, based on accurate alignment with the drawn 2-D views and considering the proportional and spatial relationships, the conclusion is:
