Analyzing the provided sequence of Rubik's cubes, we observe the following pattern based on the top face colors: 

1. In the first cube, the top colors are red, blue, and yellow, with red adjacent to blue.
2. In the second cube, the blue and yellow positions are swapped, and red stays next to yellow.
3. In the third cube, blue and red positions are swapped, and yellow stays adjacent to blue.

By analyzing the positions of red, blue, and yellow on the top face of the cube, we can predict that the next cube should have the yellow color swapped with blue, such that yellow returns to being adjacent to red again.

Reviewing the options:

- Choice 1: Yellow is between red and blue on the top face.
- Choice 2: Yellow is between blue and red on the top face, but red is on the far right.
- Choice 3: Yellow is between red and blue on the top face.
- Choice 4: Yellow is between blue and red on the top face.
- Choice 5: Yellow is between red and blue on the top face.

Comparing these choices to the observed patterns, and considering that yellow should be next to red and not directly next to blue on the far end from red (as in the current trend of rearranging while keeping a sense of visual continuity), Choice 3 appears correct. It shows the yellow and blue colors being swapped compared to previous configuration, aligning with the identified pattern.

Here is the conclusion in the requested format:
