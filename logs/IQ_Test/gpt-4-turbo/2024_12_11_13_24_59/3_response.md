To solve this, we need to analyze the arrangement and distribution of colors for each of the given pieces and match them with one of the completed cube choices. Here is the breakdown by analyzing each side and its colors:

1. **First piece**: Has yellow and gray sides with a corner where the two colors meet.
2. **Second piece**: Has blue and gray sides with a corner where these two colors meet.
3. **Third piece**: Has yellow and green sides.
4. **Fourth piece**: Has blue and green sides.

Now, let's match these with the completed cubes:

- **Choice 1**: Features green, yellow, and gray sides at the top visible face; blue and yellow on right visible face.
- **Choice 2**: Top has green, blue, and gray; right visible face has yellow and blue.
- **Choice 3**: Correct arrangement of the green and yellow sides beside each other on the top and blue, yellow, and gray exactly matching the pieces' distribution.
- **Choice 4**: Has blue, yellow patterns but does not match with the green side correctly.
- **Choice 5**: Does not align with the provided green and blue sides.

From this analysis, the colors and arrangements in Choice 3 match exactly with the colors visible and their arrangement in the cube pieces provided. Thus the correct assembled image would be:
