To determine the resulting shape after folding the original image along the dotted line:

1. Observe the original shape, a parallelogram, and its fold line which appears to be almost along the diagonal.
2. The sides of the parallelogram are going to meet each other along the fold line, resulting in one side laying on top of the other.

By comparing the shapes provided in the choices:
- Choice 1 is a smaller parallelogram but doesn't match the symmetry when folded along the indicated line.
- Choice 2 is a square, not a match as the folding would not result in squaring the angles.
- Choice 3 results in two triangles, not possible from folding one solid piece.
- Choice 4 is a different parallelogram, suggesting a fold that balances the sides differently.
- Choice 5 remains a parallelogram but aligns with the potential result of folding the original shape diagonally.

Therefore, by analyzing how the sides and angles would align when folded:
