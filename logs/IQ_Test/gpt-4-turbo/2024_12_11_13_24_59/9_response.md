To determine which folded image results from the original square diagram, it is essential to analyze the effect of folding along the dotted lines indicated in the diagram. The original diagram consists of a square with cutout shapes (triangles) at the corners, marked for folding along diagonal lines meeting at the center of the square.

Upon folding the square at these diagonal lines, each triangular corner will be folded toward the center. This leads to an arrangement where the empty middle space becomes surrounded by triangular shapes that were initially at the corners of the square.

Examination of the five choices provided reveals that the folded outcome should manifest as a smaller square in the center surrounded by these triangular shapes in a symmetrical arrangement. In the context of symmetry and correct alignment of the diagonal folds as briefed:

- **Choice 1** shows a configuration where the central square is offset and surrounded unevenly by darker and square-like borders.
- **Choice 2** reveals similar problems with symmetrical arrangement.
- **Choice 3** shows improper linkages of the shapes.
- **Choice 4** resembles a symmetrical formation but with inconsistencies in the orientation relative to the center square.
- **Choice 5** illustrates a perfectly centered square surrounded symmetrically by triangle elements that connect directly at their tips, reflecting the expected result of folding as described from the original image. The triangles align neatly, maintaining both the symmetry and balance necessary upon such folding.

Therefore, the answer given the analysis and comparison with the provided choices is:
