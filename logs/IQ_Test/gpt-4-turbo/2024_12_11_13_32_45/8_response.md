The first step is to analyze the 2-D representations in the provided image. The image shows three shapes, each with a sequence of vertical and horizontal edges:

1. The first shape has vertical segments to form a rectangular base, with a triangular top.
2. The second shape is shorter with similar features as the first.
3. The third shape seems to be a simple vertical rectangle with a triangular top.

Next, examining the 3-D choices:

- Choice 1: Shows a prism with a trapezoidal extension on one side.
- Choice 2: Similar to Choice 1 but seems to lie flat with a slight angle. 
- Choice 3: Features the shape lying flat.
- Choice 4: This choice shows a prism standing up with a flat rectangular extension on one side.
- Choice 5: The prism here also has a flat rectangular extension but slightly inclined.

Matching 3-D shapes with their 2-D orthographic projections requires seeing which 3-D shape can produce the three 2-D outlines given it being observed from different angles. The outlines suggest a shape that would produce distinct profiles, depending on angle¡ªflat front with a protruding shape and variations in widths and heights.

After comparing design features, we note that Choice 2 provides the closest match. The first outline corresponds to a front view; the second potentially from a top or off-angle view where part of the base is obscured or appears differently due to perspective; the last appears as a more traditional side view. The visual distinction and simple differences in perception without additional transformation or rotation provide the clues needed to match the projection to the 3-D shape in Choice 2.
