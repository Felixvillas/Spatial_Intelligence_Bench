To determine the next image in the sequence, let's focus on the observed changes in the face patterns across the first three cubes presented:

1. First Cube: Red, Blue - Blue, Yellow - Yellow, Green (top, front, right faces)
2. Second Cube: Blue, Red - Yellow, Blue - Green, Yellow
3. Third Cube: Red, Yellow - Blue, Green - Yellow, Blue

A visible pattern shows alternating positions of colors on different faces. It seems each face is successively swapping colors clockwise or counterclockwise.

Now let's consider each choice to see which one matches the expected continuation of the pattern:

- Choice 1: Red, Blue - Yellow, Green - Blue, Yellow
- Choice 2: Red, Yellow - Green, Blue - Yellow, Blue
- Choice 3: Red, Yellow - Blue, Green - Yellow, Blue
- Choice 4: Yellow, Red - Blue, Yellow - Green, Blue
- Choice 5: Blue, Red - Green, Yellow - Yellow, Blue

The third cube had Red, Yellow - Blue, Green - Yellow, Blue. Let's choose based on a systematic rotation or color swap notice from cube to cube.

From these selections, **Choice 3** precisely continues the previous pattern seen in Cube 3, having no change, which matches, assuming a sequence where Cube 3 is repeated if some specific condition like color positions meets. This is considering no other insight into more complicated pattern rules without further examples.
