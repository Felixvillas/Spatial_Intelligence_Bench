To identify the correct next image in the sequence, we should observe the transformations or patterns from one image to the next:

1. **First Image to Second Image**:
   - The overhanging part at the top is removed.
   - The leftmost vertical segment extends downward.
   - The bottom segment is shifted right.

2. **Second Image to Third Image**:
   - The top segment becomes thinner/slimmer.
   - The rightmost block stretches outward, making the structure more horizontal.
   - Shift or transformation predominantly affects the segments on the right.

Based on these transformations:
- The changes tend to progressively simplify and streamline the design.
- An emphasis is noticeable on altering the top segments and adjusting how the bottom and side extensions interact.

Going through the choices to see which image best fits these observations:
- **Choice 1** shows an unconnected upper extension, not matching the trend of cohesiveness.
- **Choice 2** appears more connected and cohesive, showing tuning of the block structure but adds a connecting block which is not a simple linear transformation.
- **Choice 3** is more simplified, coherent, maintaining connectivity and appears to follow a logical progression without adding or removing elements radically.
- **Choice 4** maintains most of the element structure without simplifying them.
- **Choice 5** displays a significant adjustment in the connectivity of blocks in addition to the simplification, which matches the ongoing trend closely.

Between these patterns, the choice that synthesizes the ongoing trend of simplifying and aligning is Choice 5.
