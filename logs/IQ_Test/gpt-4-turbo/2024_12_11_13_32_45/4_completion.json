Upon careful observation, we can see that the shapes rotate counterclockwise while changing the color configuration of the segments between red and yellow.\\n\\n1. First image shows the shape with three visible faces, with the top point at the upper left angle. One side red, and two sides yellow - where one yellow side is at the bottom.\\n2. Second image rotates counterclockwise to move the top point to the bottom right angle. The red part moves to occupy the bottom-left side.\\n3. Third image continues counterclockwise rotation to position the top point at the top right angle. The red part moves to be on the right side.\\n\\nFollowing this pattern:\\n\\n- The next rotation should position the top point to the lower-left angle, continuing the counterclockwise rotation.\\n- The red part should move to the upper-left side of the shape, where previously only the edge was red.\\n\\nComparing this prediction to the provided choices:\\n\\n- Choice 1 incorrectly positions the red part at the right.\\n- Choice 2 wrongly places the red part covering the middle and right side.\\n- Choice 3 adds too many segments.\\n- Choice 4 does not have any yellow segments, which contradicts the sequence.\\n- Choice 5 aligns correctly with our expectations, having the red part at the upper-left side while preserving the counterclockwise rotation.\\n\\nThus, we can conclude:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 5\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733895204,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 315,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 1619,\n        \"total_tokens\": 1934,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
