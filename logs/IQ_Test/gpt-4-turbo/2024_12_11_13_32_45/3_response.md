To solve this, we need to analyze the orientation and color placement of each cube piece in the choices given:

1. The first cube piece has a blue, yellow, and two gray faces.
2. The second cube piece has a blue, gray, and two yellow faces.
3. The third cube piece has a blue, yellow, and two green faces.
4. The fourth cube piece has two green, one yellow, and one gray face.

We will inspect each choice to see where these configurations occur:

- **Choice 1**: Upper left is two gray, blue, green (does not match any pieces); doesn't fulfill criteria.
- **Choice 2**: Upper left is two gray, blue, yellow (matches piece 1); Upper right is two yellow, blue, gray (matches piece 2); Lower left is two green, yellow, blue (matches piece 3); Lower right is green, gray, blue (this does not match any piece exactly).
- **Choice 3**: Upper left is two gray, blue, yellow (matches piece 1); Upper right is two yellow, blue, gray (matches piece 2); Lower left is two green, blue, yellow (matches piece 3); Lower right is green, yellow (matches piece 4 after adjustments). Matches correctly as per the color placements.
- **Choice 4**:  Upper two squares are all blue (does not match any piece exactly), so it fails.
- **Choice 5**: Two-, two- and one-color exposures don't match the configurations (with a maximum two-face exposure per piece).

From our observation, the configuration of the pieces and cube sides in **Choice 3** lines up with the configurations of the original cube parts provided. We will go with that.
