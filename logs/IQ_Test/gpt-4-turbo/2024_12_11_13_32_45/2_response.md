Upon examining the original image, we can observe an asymmetric quadrilateral shape. When the shape is folded along the dotted line, the left portion mirrors against the right along this dotted axis. This results in a new shape where both sides of the original are now touching, creating a symmetrical figure.

Analyzing the choices:

- Choice 1 reflects a similar shape but without the folding which would reduce its angles or alter its symmetry.
- Choice 2 results in a rectangle, which does not match the angles or proportions created by the original shape when folded.
- Choice 3 produces a "V" shape, which contrasts the idea that folding should minimize visible surface area into a compact figure.
- Choice 4 aligns with the outcome of folding an asymmetric shape along its diagonal - the edges and angles adjust to form a symmetrical trapezoid.
- Choice 5 remains similar to choice 1 in displaying an unfolded skewed shape.

Considering these reflections, the correct choice is based on symmetry and likeness to the expected folded version:
