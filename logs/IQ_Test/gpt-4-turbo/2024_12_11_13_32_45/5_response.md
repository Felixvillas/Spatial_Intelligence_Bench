The sequence provided consists of 3D block figures, and each subsequent figure appears to extend the existing structure by adding more blocks in a certain pattern related to the previous figure in the sequence. Let's examine the pattern in the sequence:

1. **First figure:** The figure resembles the number '2' or a rotated 'Z'.
2. **Second figure:** This figure looks like an 'N' turned on its side.
3. **Third figure:** This appears as a 'Z' turned on its side, resembling an extended version of the first figure with an additional block.

To guess the pattern sequence, one should continue the apparent trend, which seems to involve the addition of more blocks in a new orientation. Each figure builds off the essential "tick" shape of the previous one, mirrored or adjusted.

Let's look at the next figure options:

- **Choice 1:** Consists of 4 blocks in an 'L' shape, which does not seem to follow.
- **Choice 2:** 5 blocks in a kind of zigzag, but it doesn't clearly extend from the third figure.
- **Choice 3:** 4 blocks, but they set up like a 'J' or backwards 'L', not quite following.
- **Choice 4:** 5 blocks in a more extended zigzag pattern.
- **Choice 5:** 5 blocks resembling an extended version of the second figure with the zigzag bending the other way.

Upon closer inspection, **Choice 5** seems the most logical next step as it visualizes an extended pattern of bending in alternating directions between the second and third figures by taking the form presented in the third and bending its tail back in an inverse direction compared to the second figure. Thus, it maintains the extended zigzag or 'N', 'Z' pattern that seems to be forming.
