To solve this, it is necessary to check which of the given pieces is not present in the complete assembled block.

1. Analyze the different shaped blocks depicted in the first image:
   - The light blue flat block is present.
   - The yellow L-shaped block is present.

2. From the choices available, each appears as a different arrangement of purple cubes. To determine which one is missing, visualize how each would fit within the cube.

3. By comparing the blocks:
   - Choice 1 is a simple vertical stacking of three blocks on top and two on the second layer down.
   - Choice 2 is an L-shape that¡¯s six cubes total.
   - Choice 3 is an L-shape with an additional step-down, totally seven cubes.
   - Choice 4 includes a vertical block of three with two aside, plus another two stacked on one of the bottom cubes.
   - Choice 5 has a boxy "jagged" corner shape.

4. None of the choices directly matches the pink area's shape and size in the assembled block or includes only six cubes in the exact arrangement within the original block.

The conclusion is:
