The folding process shown in the original sequence of images involves making two major folds based on the dotted lines. Following the steps given:

1. Start with a whole triangle.
2. First fold is along the vertical dotted line, resulting in the triangle being half folded with two layers.
3. The second fold involves bending the half folded section backward along the horizontal dotted line shown.

Observing the folded triangle and ensuring that the image orientation and relative positions of the triangles' legs match the sequence:

- Choice 1 and Choice 5 are similar, having an extra triangle on the right side.
- Choice 2 has the extra triangle on the right side and the main triangle's hypotenuse facing upwards.
- Choice 3 shows an inverted version compared to the likely scenario based on the folds.
- Choice 4 appears as a flipped version of the expected result.

Among these, the arrangement and the visible triangular sections in Choice 1 best correspond to the logical result of sequentially folding the given pattern.
