To solve this sequence puzzle, it's important to observe both the shapes and the number of sections (colored areas) in each image.

1. In the first image, the shape is a diamond split into three sections: two red sections that are diagonally opposite and two yellow sections. Additionally, there are three dark dots.
2. In the second image, one red section seems to have moved, changing the orientation and the lines dividing the colors. There are two yellow sections and one red section.
3. Similarly, in the third image, it maintains a three-section division: one red, two yellow, but now with two sides of the image in a straight line.

Analyzing these transitions, the changes primarily involve the movement or rotation of the sections inside each shape. To guess the next in the sequence:

- There might be a continual simplification and reduction in the complexity of lines and colors transitioning based on how the segments are realigned in the past steps.
- The images show a trend where the segments inside the shapes shift toward a simpler, more stable configuration with fewer intersecting lines.

Looking at each choice:
- **Choice 1** involves a three-section shape with the colors roughly maintaining the positions from the previous image but slightly altered in angles.
- **Choice 2** displays similar features to Choice 1, but the orientation and intersections are different.
- **Choice 3** introduces an entirely different division with more sections, which breaks the observed simplifying pattern.
- **Choice 4** shows only one color, which is a reduction but doesn't match the dual-color pattern of the sequence.
- **Choice 5** also demonstrates a split similar to previous figures but distinctly retains a vertical line which wasn't a trend in the sequence.

From the understanding, **Choice 1** seems the most likely answer as it follows the trend of repositioning the existing sections into a slightly new alignment, keeping the element of simplicity and following the pattern of the sequence. None of the other choices except Choice 2 closely follow this logic, but Choice 1 does it more neatly. Thus, the selected choice is:
