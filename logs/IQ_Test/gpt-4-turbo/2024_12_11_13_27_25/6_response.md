Let's analyze the progression of the shapes in the provided sequence.

1. The first shape is a complex geometric form with multiple levels.
2. The second shape retains a similar framework but simplifies by removing one of the vertical elements at the back.
3. The third shape further simplifies by removing additional segments and reducing the complexity even more.

Given the trend of reducing complexity and segments, we should look for a shape in the choices that simplifies even further from the third shape in the sequence:

- Choice 1 adds complexity which does not match the trend.
- Choice 2 maintains a similar complexity to the third shape but doesn¡¯t simplify further.
- Choice 3 similarly retains elements of complexity.
- Choice 4 simplifies further by smoothing out the segments and decreasing the overall structure.
- Choice 5 does not simplify further; it retains a similar complexity by adjusting the shape.

Based on the analysis, Choice 4 best fits the next step in the sequence by simplifying the design further compared to the previous steps.
