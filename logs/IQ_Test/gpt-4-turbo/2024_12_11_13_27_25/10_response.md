Observing the sequence depicted in the question, when the original triangle is folded along the dotted lines, the last shape on the right shows the triangle after a sequence of folds, with the upper right corner turned over along the latest dotted line. The superimposed shape has solid lines where the borders lie and dotted lines where the folds occurred.

Reviewing the five options given:
- **Choice 1:** The diagram includes multiple triangles, but one segment of the shape does not align with any segment of the final folded shape in the query image.
- **Choice 2:** Similar to choice 1, incorrect alignment with wrong angles.
- **Choice 3:** Incorrect, as there are additional line segments that are not represented in the question's folded figure.
- **Choice 4:** The lines and angles match perfectly with the folded shape provided in the question.
- **Choice 5:** Similar to choices 1 and 2 in parts, but again not correctly representing the folded figure.

The correct choice is the one where the shape aligns perfectly with all edges of the folded figure, represented by solid lines and corresponds to the final folding result, which is Choice 4.
