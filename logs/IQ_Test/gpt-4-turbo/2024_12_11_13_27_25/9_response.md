To find which image results from folding the given sheet along the dotted lines, we need to understand the symmetry and the pattern of folds.

1. The original square is set on a diagonal angle (45 degrees) relative to the grid. The dashed lines represent the intended folds.
2. The solid lines inside the square represent edges of the shape after folding. These lines should help create mirrored sections along the dashed lines.

On observing the possible choices:

- **Choice 1**  : The resulting pattern does not correspond to the configuration of the fold lines as it appears too intricate and the central square is turned the wrong way.
- **Choice 2**  : The symmetry and mirror images of the shapes with respect to the fold lines is incorrect and shapes do not match with the unfolding.
- **Choice 3**  : The symmetry seems incorrect as the shapes on the diagonal fold lines are not mirrored correctly in the center.
- **Choice 4**  : This choice appears similar to the expected result from the folding pattern shown in the diagram. The center square and the triangles along the sides correspond to the fold lines and the prior shape.
- **Choice 5**  : The center square is turned differently from the expected fold pattern, and the shapes do not mirror correctly along the folds.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer appears to be:
