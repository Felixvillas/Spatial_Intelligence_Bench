To solve this puzzle, let's look at each of the four individual pieces and how they fit together to make a complete cube.

1. **First piece:** Combination of all four colors (yellow, green, blue, and a grey face).
2. **Second piece:** Consists of a blue color face and three grey faces.
3. **Third piece:** Comprises yellow, grey, green, and a blue face.
4. **Fourth piece:** Consists of a green face with three grey faces.

Next, let's analyze how the colors on each piece could be combined to form a correct cube alignment:

- **Top view of the cube must show all colors.**
- **Side faces must match up accurately with the corresponding colors.**

Let's now evaluate each choice:

- **Choice 1:** Features a top sequence going clockwise (Blue, Grey, Green, Yellow). Side colors are visible as Green on the far left and almost full Yellow on the near right.
- **Choice 2:** Visible parts include Blue and Grey on top, Green on the bottom right, and Yellow to the bottom left.
- **Choice 3:** Shows (Yellow, Grey, Green, Blue) on the top in a clockwise arrangement. 
- **Choice 4:** Displays (Yellow, Grey, Blue, Blue) on the top. 
- **Choice 5:** Shows full Blue and partial Grey on top.

Out of these, the arrangement where each color appears equally on the top and sides align most accurately is where the top colors are well distributed, and side colors are visible as in the provided options. **Choice 3** appears to be the correct composition as on top we have the four colors well positioned and sides seem to align with how the cube pieces can form sides with matching colors in the visible orientations.
