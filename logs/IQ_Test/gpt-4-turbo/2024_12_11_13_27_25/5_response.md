The given sequence appears to be rotating the three-dimensional shapes in a certain manner around a specific axis. Analyzing the rotations:

1. The first shape is oriented to start from the left, moving right and then down.
2. The second shape rotates a bit clockwise regarding the first, aligning more vertically.
3. The third shape rotates further clockwise, aligning with the shape standing and bent, more vertical.

Considering this pattern of continuous clockwise rotation around the same horizontal-ish axis, the next image logically would follow the same trend:

- Shape 1 does not seem correct as it relates to the initial position of the first shape.
- Shape 2 is incorrect, facing the wrong direction.
- Shape 3 is incorrect and posed similarly to shape 2.
- Shape 4 is the correct next rotation, continuing the pattern.
- Shape 5 is incorrect and in an earlier rotation than needed.

Hence, the correct answer is:
