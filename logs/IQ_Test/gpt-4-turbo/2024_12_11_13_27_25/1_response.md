To determine which piece is missing when the block is disassembled, let's analyze the block contents and their shapes displayed in the series of three blocks at the beginning of the question:

1. The first image from the left in the question series appears to represent the assembled block. Upon inspection, it doesn't explicitly outline all the pieces making up the block; hence, we need to look at the possible L-shaped block configurations to identify a missing shape.

2. The second and third images in the question series show two distinct L-shaped configurations, with blue and yellow colors respectively. They seem to be potential candidates for making up parts of the larger assembled block.

Now, considering each choice:

- **Choice 1**: This shape is a cube with five smaller cubes, arranged with an extension on top, almost forming a corner or stair shape. 
- **Choice 2**: The configuration is almost the same as in Choice 1, but with a straight 4-cube shape and an additional cube attached on the side towards the base.
- **Choice 3**: This shape extends further out, resembling a more complex L-shaped configuration with six cubes forming a stepped stagger.
- **Choice 4**: This is a compact L-shape formed by stacking 4 cubes, with 3 at the base and one centered on top.
- **Choice 5**: This option has a simple vertical L-shape formed by 4 cubes, with 3 in a line and one attached at the end on the base.

Upon closely examining the main assembled block in the first image and the available options, it seems that the block configurations displayed do not explicitly include a missing piece from these options. Furthermore, the disassembled shapes in the second and third images do not entirely indicate that any one of these choices is explicitly absent.

A clearer deduction would be possible with a more detailed understanding of the blocks that make up the assembled block. However, considering general cube puzzle assembly and typical missing pieces in such scenarios:

**Choice 4** appears to be the most standard L-shape that may fit commonly within other configurations, potentially being less unique. It could possibly be inferred as not needed if other shapes provide similar configurations when combined.

Thus, our analyzed output based on potential deduction (since no pieces are visibly missing from what can be directly observed) is:
