The 2-D representations shown in the image represent different views: frontal, top, and one side of a 3-D object. The views are distinctive because they exhibit straight and angled lines as well as distinct geometric shapes.

Let's analyze each option:
- **Choice 1**: Appears to have a top shape, a frontal view, and a side view that match the polygons and silhouette of the 2-D representations. It shows the distinct angles and lines seen in the 2-D shapes provided.
- **Choice 2**: The front view matches but the side view shows a base extending backward that does not match any of the 2-D representations.
- **Choice 3**: The front view matches but the side view is more protruded and different than the 2-D representations.
- **Choice 4**: The front and top views match but the side view has a different angle and outwards extension than shown in the 2-D views.
- **Choice 5**: Similar to choice 2 with a different orientation that does not exactly match the 2-D views.

The best match across all views comes from **Choice 1**. Each of the three views seen in the 3-D representation corresponds most closely to the 2-D shapes.
