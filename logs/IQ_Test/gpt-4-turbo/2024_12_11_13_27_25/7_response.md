To find the next image in the sequence, we must look at the patterns or changes occurring across the series of cubes:

1. The first cube has a row of red, blue, and red tiles on the top face.
2. The second cube has a row of red, yellow, and red tiles on the top face.
3. The third cube has a row of red, yellow, and blue tiles on the top face.

From these details, we can discern a pattern in the colors in the first position on the first row and the last position on the first row which stay as reds. The change is occurring only in the middle position of the top row, which transitions from blue to yellow, then to blue again.

Looking at the choices:
- Choice 1 has red, yellow, and blue tiles in the top row.
- Choice 2 has red, red, and blue tiles in the top row.
- Choice 3 has red, yellow, and blue tiles in the top row.
- Choice 4 has red, yellow, and blue tiles in the top row.
- Choice 5 has red, yellow, and red tiles in the top row.

To continue the sequence pattern observed:
- From blue (choice 1) to yellow (choice 2) and back to blue (choice 3)

The next change in the pattern that hasn't been used between choices 1, 2, and 3 is red, yellow, and red. So, we need a cube that has these tiles on the top face. Choice 5 fits this description.
