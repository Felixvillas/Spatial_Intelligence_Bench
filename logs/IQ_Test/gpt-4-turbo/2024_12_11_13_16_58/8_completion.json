Each of these views depicts a vertical projection onto different planes. Analyzing the configurations and comparing them with the options given:\\n\\n- Choice 1 has a base and a protruding upper part which extends further than the base in the front view.\\n- Choice 2 has a base and a protruding upper part which does not extend beyond the base in the front view.\\n- Choice 3 shows an upper part that protrudes both in front and back relative to the base, and the base appears broader as it extends outwards in these directions.\\n- Choice 4 has a base with the upper part not extending beyond both sides equally.\\n- Choice 5 features a stepped side view, where the base extends further back, but the upper part only protrudes in front, not extending beyond the base in this view.\\n\\nGiven these observations, the 3-D shape that corresponds to the 2-D views provided appears to match the configuration shown in Choice 2, where the base is consistent in depth in the side view (no extended protrusion in front or back), and the upper part is aligned with the base, not extending beyond it in the front view.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"answer\\\": 2\\n}\\n```\",\n                \"refusal\": null,\n                \"role\": \"assistant\",\n                \"audio\": null,\n                \"function_call\": null,\n                \"tool_calls\": null\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"created\": 1733894322,\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09\",\n    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",\n    \"service_tier\": null,\n    \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_0f602ebbda\",\n    \"usage\": {\n        \"completion_tokens\": 274,\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 1624,\n        \"total_tokens\": 1898,\n        \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n            \"accepted_prediction_tokens\": 0,\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"reasoning_tokens\": 0,\n            \"rejected_prediction_tokens\": 0\n        },\n        \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n            \"audio_tokens\": 0,\n            \"cached_tokens\": 0\n        }\n    }\n}"
