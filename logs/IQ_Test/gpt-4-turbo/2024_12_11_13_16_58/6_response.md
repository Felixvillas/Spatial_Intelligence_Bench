To determine which image is next in the sequence, let's analyze the progression of the forms in the three given images:

1. The first image presents a form that looks somewhat like an upright '4' from the top, consisting of two columns and an extension on the top left.
2. In the second image, the two-column structure remains, but the left column looks more like a backward 'L', and the right column is slightly taller.
3. The third image seem to simplify further; it also presents two main columns but aligned more linearly with a clear division.

By examining each choice based on the simplification and alignment trend observed in the sequence:
- Choice 1 has an extra component at the back which doesn't fit the observed simplification.
- Choice 2 introduces unnecessary complexity with an additional protrusion.
- Choice 3 maintains a simple dual column structure, aligning well with the trend but mirrors it horizontally, which hasn¡¯t been indicated by the prior images.
- Choice 4 is the simplest and aligns very closely with the last form in the sequence by maintaining the two main parts without extras or confusion.
- Choice 5 adds an extension to the back, which complicates the form again.

Thus, considering the trend for simplification and alignment in the sequence, the correct answer appears to be:
