Based on the folding steps shown in the initial sequence of images:

1. The triangle is folded along the vertical midpoint resulting in two congruent right-angled triangles.
2. The folded triangle is then further folded along the indicated horizontal line in the middle of the right triangle's hypotenuse.

Now, analyzing the possible choices and matching them with the above folding:

- **Choice 1**: The pattern of angular shapes and their orientation does not correctly match the expected result of the folding process.
- **Choice 2**: The pattern and orientation closely resemble the final shape where the smaller triangle piece flips upwards aligning at the hypotenuse of the larger right triangle.
- **Choice 3**: Similar to choice 1, this choice does not accurately reflect the successive folds.
- **Choice 4**: The angles and precise assembly of lines again do not resemble the outcome of the two-step fold.
- **Choice 5**: The orientation and overall shape do not result from the indicated folds.

From this analysis, the shape that would result from continuing the folds along the dotted lines most closely matches **Choice 2**.
