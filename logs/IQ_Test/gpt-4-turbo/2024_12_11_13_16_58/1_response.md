To solve this, let's break down the images:

1. The main block image shows a 3x3x3 cube.
2. There are three distinctive piece shapes shown outside the full block.

By examining the unique shapes of the supplied pieces and considering how they fit into the cube, we can determine which additional piece could complete the full figure while matching the design pattern:

- The first small shape consists of 4 cubes forming a smaller cube.
- The second shape is an "L" formed by 4 cubes.
- The third shape is a more complex "snake" or "zigzag" built from 5 cubes.

None of the shapes outside the full block appears to consist of any pink cubes, indicating that the missing piece must comprise entirely of pink cubes. Analyzing the distinct shapes of the options provided:

- **Choice 1** consists of 5 pink cubes forming a "plus" shape.
- **Choice 2** consists of 5 pink cubes forming a straight "L" shape.
- **Choice 3** consists of 5 pink cubes forming a complex "zigzag" shape.
- **Choice 4** consists of 5 pink cubes in a format similar to choice 1 but slightly different due to orientation.
- **Choice 5** consists of 5 pink cubes in a simple "L" shape.

Upon careful observation and mentally placing each in the cube matrix:
- **Choice 3** seems to provide a unique arrangement of the pink cubes that doesn't overlap with any visible blocks in the primary block image, fitting snugly into a potential space inside the 3x3x3 block.

Thus, the correct answer is:
