To determine the next image in the sequence, let's analyze the patterns exhibited in the given three images:

1. The first image looks like a zigzag or a '2' from a digital clock.
2. The second image represents a number '1'.
3. The third image represents a number '3'.

Based on this sequence (2, 1, 3), the next logical step might involve another number. It seems these images are structured to represent sequential numbers. Observing each choice:

- Choice 1 is a simple shape without clear numerical representation.
- Choice 2 and Choice 4 are various arrangements not clearly showing any single numerical identity.
- Choice 3 seems to represent the number '4'.
- Choice 5 itself does not clearly resemble an immediate subsequent numerical pattern.

Since we are possibly looking for a numeric progression and having '1', '2', and '3' already, the best fit for a sequential interpretation would be the image representing the number '4':
