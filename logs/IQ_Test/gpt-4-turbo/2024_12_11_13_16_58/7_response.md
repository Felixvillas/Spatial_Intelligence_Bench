To determine which image should come next in the sequence, we need to analyze the orientation and color placement of the visible faces in the Rubik¡¯s Cube in each image.

1. The first cube in the sequence shows the top colors as red, white, blue (left to right) and the side colors visible are yellow, blue, yellow (top to bottom).
2. The second cube shows the top colors as blue, yellow, blue (left to right) and the side colors visible are yellow, yellow, red (top to bottom).
3. The third cube shows the top colors as blue, blue, yellow (left to right) and the side colors visible are red, yellow, yellow (top to bottom).

Analyzing the patterns among these cubes:
- Top colors are shifting positions with blue and yellow swapping places and red moving out of frame on the third cube.
- Side colors are rearranging with red moving down the side of the cube and yellow dominating the visible stacks.

Now, I will check each choice to see which fits next by following the pattern:
- Blue colors are increasingly grouped on top.
- Red color seems to be shifting downwards on the side.

Checking the choices:
- Choice 1: Top - red, yellow, blue; Side - yellow, green, gray.
- Choice 2: Top - red, blue, yellow; Side - yellow, yellow, red.
- Choice 3: Top - red, blue, blue; Side - yellow, green, gray.
- Choice 4: Top - yellow, yellow, red; Side - blue, yellow, gray.
- Choice 5: Top - red, blue, yellow; Side - yellow, yellow, red.

Given the observed patterns, we look for the continuation of blue groupings on top; the arrangement where the yellow appears more on the side, and red is expected to occupy the lower part of the side, but mostly more blue and yellow on top, with red diminishing.

**Choice 5** shows the top as red, blue, yellow (a similar arrangement with increasing blue presence next to red and pushing the yellow to the edge just like the third cube in the sequence) and side configuration fits; thus it seems most logical to follow the sequence pointing towards grouping blue and minimizing the visible red.
