Analyzing the sequence of images provided, it appears that the pattern involves rotating and subdividing a geometric shape consisting of red and yellow regions. If we consider the orientation and the number of divisions in each subsequent image, we observe:

1. The first image has a rhombus divided into four segments, with different orientations.
2. In the second image, the shape is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and lacks the top segment.
3. In the third image, the two segments on the right stack vertically with no rotation relative to the second image.

Following this pattern, the next shape in the sequence should maintain this clock-wise rotation and segment stacking strategy. Upon reviewing the choices:

- `Choice 1` features a diagonal division which does not follow from the previous image.
- `Choice 2` has a prescribed diagonal division and stacking that contradicts the established pattern of segment placement.
- `Choice 3` introduces additional segments that do not correlate with the expected progression.
- `Choice 4` does not include the correct segment orientation or color distribution.
- `Choice 5` demonstrates a continuation of the clockwise rotation and existing division, aligning well with the pattern.

Therefore, the next image in the sequence is best represented by `Choice 5`.
