Let's analyze how the parts come together based on the colors visible in each position.

1. The first piece has grey and yellow faces.
2. The second piece has blue faces.
3. The third piece has yellow and green faces.
4. The fourth piece has green and blue faces.

With this in mind, to construct the cube, we need to consider the orientation in which these pieces are assembled to ensure that all faces are covered appropriately, and the colors need to be correctly positioned next to each other with no color repeated on any side.

Analyzing the choices:
- **Choice 1**: Shows blue, green, yellow, and grey sides. This choice corresponds to all the part colors used.
- **Choice 2**: Includes colors that aren¡¯t in any single block or is not visible in possible orientations (grey and blue on adjacent squares are not found in any single block).
- **Choice 3**: Has yellow and green adjacent squares, which aligns with the available pieces.
- **Choice 4**: This does not correspond as the pieces cannot be aligned to get this color configuration.
- **Choice 5**: Does not form a possible configuration if all pieces are used correctly according to the colored sides available.

After careful consideration and checking configurations, **Choice 3** displays a possible arrangement of the colors of the blocks given, correctly adjacent in accordance with the blocks' colors provided.
