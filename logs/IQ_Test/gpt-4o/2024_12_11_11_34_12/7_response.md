To determine the next image in sequence, let's analyze the pattern:

1. **First Image:**
   - Top: Red
   - Front: Yellow
   - Right: Blue

2. **Second Image:**
   - Top: Red
   - Front: Blue
   - Right: Gray

3. **Third Image:**
   - Top: Yellow
   - Front: Blue
   - Right: Gray, with a green square on bottom row

Observing the changes:
- The top face color changes from Red to Yellow.
- The colors of the side faces shift in a clockwise direction around the cube.

Following the pattern, the next cube should have:
- **Top Face:** Same as third image (Yellow)
- **Colors on Sides:** Rotated clockwise on the visible faces.

By matching these observations with the choices given, the correct sequence follows in Choice 1:

- **Top Face:** Yellow
- **Front Face:** Red (from the right side of the previous cube)
- **Right Face:** Green (from the bottom of the previous cube)

Therefore, the next image is Choice 1.
