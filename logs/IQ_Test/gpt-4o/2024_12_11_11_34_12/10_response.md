To determine the resulting shape from folding along the dotted lines, follow these steps:

1. Identify that the first shape can fold symmetrically along the vertical dotted line.
2. Fold the rectangular portion over the triangular portion.
3. The second shape involves folding corners. Notice it creates a smaller, central triangle.
4. Visualize the finished combination of the triangular flaps.

After reviewing these steps, the correct resulting shape corresponds to choice 4.
