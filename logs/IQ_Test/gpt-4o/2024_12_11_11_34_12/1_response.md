To solve this, let's analyze the blocks.

The initial block is composed of three smaller blocks:

1. A blue block on the bottom right.
2. A yellow block forming an "L" shape.
3. A magenta block on the top left.

The magenta block is the missing piece we're looking for. Now, compare the shape of the magenta blocks in the choices:

- The magenta block is a 3x2x1 block placed on top of the structure.

By examining the choices:

- The correct choice is the one with no block extending more than two cubes high and three cubes long.

From the above observation, the correct missing block is Choice 5.
