To determine which image is next in the sequence, let's analyze the pattern:

1. The sequence involves a recurring geometric shape that increases in complexity with each step.
2. Each new shape seems to have an additional block added in a logical position, building on the previous shape.

Following this pattern, let's review each choice:

- **Choice 1**: Adds one block from the previous figure in sequence.
- **Choice 2**: Adds two blocks.
- **Choice 3**: Matches the expected addition of a block based on the previous figure.
- **Choice 4**: Adds multiple blocks.
- **Choice 5**: Matches the expected addition of a block based on the previous figure.

Among these:

- Choices 3 and 5 are candidates that correctly follow the pattern of adding a logical, single block from the last figure.
  
Upon closer evaluation, **Choice 5** correctly follows the pattern and matches the structure change, extending the shapes logically.
