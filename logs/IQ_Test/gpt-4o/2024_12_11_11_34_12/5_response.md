To determine the next image in the sequence, let's analyze the pattern step by step:

1. **Observation of the Sequence:**
   - Each shape is made of blocks.
   - The first image has a zigzag-like shape.
   - The second image expands further, forming an almost cubic structure.
   - The third image forms a diagonal shape.

2. **Understanding the Transition:**
   - The sequence seems to slightly rotate or change the orientation of the configuration.
   - The number of blocks remains constant; only their arrangement changes.
   - The third image is a rotated version of the first two, maintaining the same block count and connection pattern.

3. **Analysis of the Choices:**
   - We are searching for a pattern that continues the orientation change or completes a rotation.
   - The rotation seems to progress by altering the perspective angle of the arrangement.

Upon considering these points, Choice 3 aligns well with the sequence, as it continues the rotational progression seen from the first to the third shape.
