To determine which shape will result when the image is folded along the dotted line, let's follow these steps:

1. The original image is a parallelogram with a vertical dotted line suggesting it should be folded vertically.
2. Folding along the dotted line means bringing the two halves together.
3. Upon folding, the resulting shape should have two trapezoidal parts combined along the dotted line.

Now, let's look at the choices:

- Choice 1: A full parallelogram.
- Choice 2: A perfect square.
- Choice 3: Two adjacent connected parts, symmetrical.
- Choice 4: Two overlapping triangles forming a symmetrical shape.
- Choice 5: A smaller parallelogram or half shape.

The correct result will be two adjacent and symmetrical parts forming after folding. Therefore, it matches:
