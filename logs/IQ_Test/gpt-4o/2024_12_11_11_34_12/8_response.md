To solve this problem, we need to match the 2-D projections with their corresponding 3-D shape. Let's break it down:

1. **Examine the 2-D projections:**
   - The first projection has a pentagon base with an extruding, longer portion upward.
   - The second projection is similar, with slightly different proportions.
   - The third projection seems like a reflection or another angle showing a similar shape.

2. **Examine the 3-D shape choices:**
   - **Choice 1:** This shape has a matching base, but angles and lengths aren't quite correct.
   - **Choice 2:** The facets appear wrong compared to the projections.
   - **Choice 3:** Again, angles and lengths seem off.
   - **Choice 4:** This shape has a simple base that might match when seen from a certain angle.
   - **Choice 5:** Angles and facets appear incorrect for the given projections.

Choice 4 seems like the best fit, given that it provides a consistent reflection of the 2-D perspectives.
