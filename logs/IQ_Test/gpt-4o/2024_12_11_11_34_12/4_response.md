To solve this, let's examine the sequence:

1. The initial image in the sequence shows the shape with the front face (red) on the left.
2. The second image rotates clockwise so that the red face is now the top, left of center.
3. The third image continues the clockwise rotation, bringing the red face to the top, facing directly up.

Following this pattern, the next shape should have the red face rotating to the top-right side. Therefore, from the choices given:

Choice 4 has the red face in the expected direction.
