To determine the next image in the sequence, let's analyze each image in the original sequence to identify any patterns:

1. **First Image**: This shows a single column of cubes (3 cubes long).
2. **Second Image**: This is a 3D structure made up of 2 columns of cubes (3 cubes long), forming a "T" shape.
3. **Third Image**: This shows a rotated version of the second image where one column is vertical, and the other is flat.

The sequence involves a 3D change and rotation in position and orientation. Starting from a simple form, it evolves to a more complex structure and then changes orientation.

Looking at the choices:

- **Choice 1**: A "T" shape similar to the second image but rotated differently.
- **Choice 2**: A different arrangement, not matching any previous form or suggesting complexity.
- **Choice 3**: Does not fit the sequence pattern (non-cube shape).
- **Choice 4**: Another "L" shape similar to Choice 1 but oriented differently.
- **Choice 5**: Appears similar in complexity and structure to the transition between second and third images.

Based on the incremental complexity and rotational aspect, **Choice 5** seems to follow the established pattern of rotation and complexity as it shows a similar step-up and change in orientation to what appears to be required.
