To identify the next image in the sequence, let's observe the given pattern:

1. Each image seems to be a 3D shape that is rotating or flipping.
2. Focusing on color and position changes: 
   - The red face remains constant, facing forward throughout the sequence.
   - The yellow face is moving up by one section each time.

From the sequence, it follows that the yellow section should move upward until it's on the top of the shape and the red section should remain in view.

Choice 1 has the red section facing forward and the yellow section has moved upwards, consistent with the sequence.

Hence, the next image should be Choice 1.
