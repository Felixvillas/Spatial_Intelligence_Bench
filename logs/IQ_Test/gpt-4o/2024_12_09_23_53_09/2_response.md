To solve this problem, let's analyze the folding process step-by-step:

1. Consider the original shape, which is a parallelogram.
2. The dotted line divides this parallelogram into two congruent right triangles.
3. When you fold along the dotted line, one triangle will lie on top of the other, maintaining the shape of a triangle.

Now, let's compare the resulting shape with the given choices:

- Choice 1: Shows a parallelogram, which is incorrect.
- Choice 2: Shows a square, which is incorrect.
- Choice 3: Shows two triangles making a V shape, which is incorrect.
- Choice 4: Shows two congruent triangles forming a smaller parallelogram, which is correct.
- Choice 5: Shows one triangle, which would be the result of the fold.

The resulting shape after folding is consistent with Choice 5.
