To determine the resulting shape from folding the image along the dotted lines, follow these steps:

1. **First Shape (Triangle):** Fold along the vertical dotted line to create a smaller triangle.
2. **Second Shape (Pentagon):** Fold along the horizontal line to tuck in the small flap.
3. **Combine Shapes:** This folding pattern will create a complex shape.

By visualizing these steps, it matches the structure seen in choice 2.

Thus, the resulting shape is choice 2.
