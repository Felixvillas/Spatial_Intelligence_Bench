To figure out which image is next in the sequence, let's analyze the given sequence step by step:

1. The first image shows a structure forming a certain shape.
2. In the second image, an additional block or layer is added on top of the existing structure.
3. In the third image, yet another block is added, following a consistent pattern.

Observing the sequence:
- The structure is being incrementally built by adding one cube at a time in a specific direction.

Now let's see which choice continues this pattern:

- **Choice 1**: Adds a cube to the back.
- **Choice 2**: Adds two cubes, not following the one-cube increment.
- **Choice 3**: Adds a cube in front.
- **Choice 4**: Adds a cube correctly in the same direction as the previous images.
- **Choice 5**: Adds a cube incorrectly out of pattern.

The most likely next step in the sequence is **Choice 4**, as it correctly follows the single-cube gradual increment pattern.
