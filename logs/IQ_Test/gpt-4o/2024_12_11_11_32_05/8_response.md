To identify which 3-D shape corresponds to the 2-D representations, we need to analyze each perspective:

1. **Front View**: The shape has a distinctive trapezoidal top part and a wider base. Look for a similar silhouette in the choices.

2. **Side View**: Identify the side profile that matches a similar shape. It should have consistent features that are visible from the side like the trapezoidal top.

3. **Top View**: Look for a similar top-down perspective shape which aligns with the front and side profiles.

Now, let's match these perspectives with the choices provided:

- **Choice 1**: This seems to fit the front and side views, but the perspective is not consistent.
- **Choice 2**: This matches well with all three views.
- **Choice 3**: This also matches but the orientation looks slightly off from the front perspective.
- **Choice 4**: This does not match the top view correctly.
- **Choice 5**: This does not match the side perspective accurately.

Based on the evaluations, **Choice 2** aligns well with all given 2-D perspectives.
