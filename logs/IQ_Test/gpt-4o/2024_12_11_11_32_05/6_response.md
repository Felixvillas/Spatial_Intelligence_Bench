To solve the sequence, observe the changes happening to the block structure from one image to the next.

1. **Initial Observation**: Each step in the sequence involves adding a block at the bottom left of the current shape.
   
2. **First to Second Image**: One block is added at the bottom left.
   
3. **Second to Third Image**: Another block is added at the bottom left.

Based on this pattern, the next image should have one more block added to the bottom left of the structure in the third image.

**Analyzing Choices**:
- **Choice 1**: Incorrect placement
- **Choice 2**: Incorrect placement
- **Choice 3**: Correct placement (an additional block at the bottom left)
- **Choice 4**: Incorrect placement
- **Choice 5**: Incorrect placement

The next image in the sequence is Choice 3.
