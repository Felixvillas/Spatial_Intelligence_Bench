To determine the next image in the sequence, let's analyze the pattern in the initial set of three images. 

1. **First Image:** Shows interconnected blocks with a specific angle and orientation.
2. **Second Image:** The same blocks are rotated more counter-clockwise.
3. **Third Image:** Continued rotation of the blocks counter-clockwise.

The pattern involves the blocks being rotated counter-clockwise in the same orientation in each step.

Now let's compare the choices:

- **Choice 5:** This choice continues the counter-clockwise rotation of the structure seen in the sequence. It seems to match the expected continuation of the rotation pattern.
