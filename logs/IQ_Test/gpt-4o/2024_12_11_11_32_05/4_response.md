To solve this, let's observe the sequence:

1. The first image shows a shape with red on the front face, yellow on the bottom, and a triangular shape on the side.
2. The second image shows a counterclockwise rotation of the shape.
3. The third image also shows a continuation of the counterclockwise rotation.

The rotation is around the vertical axis, where the shape turns counterclockwise. The yellow face is consistently at the bottom in all images.

Following this pattern, the next image should be a continuation of this rotation:

- The red face would be on the side.
- The yellow face would remain on the bottom.
  
Choice 1 matches this description with the correct orientation and colors.
