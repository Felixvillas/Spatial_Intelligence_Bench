To solve this problem, we need to assemble the four rectangular pieces to form a cube. Each piece is a rectangular prism that covers two adjacent faces of the cube.

Let's analyze the colors on the four pieces and how they can form a cube:

1. **First piece**: Yellow and gray
2. **Second piece**: Blue and gray
3. **Third piece**: Yellow and blue
4. **Fourth piece**: Green and blue

We need to ensure that all six sides of the cube are covered with the pieces provided. The cube will have the following faces covered with specific colors:

- There should be a yellow, blue, gray, and green face on the cube, with blue being repeated on two neighboring faces as seen in the provided pieces.

Examining the choices:
- Choice 5 correctly places the colors of each piece so that all combinations set by each pair of colors on the pieces are adjacent on the cube.

So, the correct choice is **Choice 5**.
