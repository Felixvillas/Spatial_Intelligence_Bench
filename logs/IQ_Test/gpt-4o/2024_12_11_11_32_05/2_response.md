To determine the resulting shape when the original shape is folded along the dotted line:

1. **Examine the Original Shape**: 
   - The original shape is a parallelogram with a dotted line running through the middle.
   
2. **Analyze Folding**:
   - Folding along the dotted line, which is the axis of symmetry of the parallelogram, will result in a shape that is half of the original and symmetrical along the fold.
   
3. **Consider the Choices**:
   - Choice 5 matches the result of folding the parallelogram along its axis, as it results in a smaller, identical parallelogram.

Therefore, the resulting shape is Choice 5.
