To find the next image in the sequence, let's analyze the changes between the given cubes:

1. The first cube has solid colors on each face.
2. The second cube has a small shift, with the yellow side moving clockwise.
3. The third cube shows further shifts with new colors appearing.

We need to see how the colors shift:

- In moving from the second to the third cube, the blue top face's edge starts showing yellow and the yellow face shows more blue.
- This pattern of shifting seems to rotate colors clockwise around the cube's visible edges.

Choices analysis:
- Choice 1: The colors are shifting similarly to the given sequence.
- Choice 2: The pattern does not fit the shift seen in the sequence.
- Choice 3: Maintains the same shift pattern as in the given sequence.
- Choice 4: The colors do not fit the sequence.
- Choice 5: Does not maintain the stepwise shift.

Given these observations, the next image is Choice 3 as it best represents a continuation of the color shift pattern.
