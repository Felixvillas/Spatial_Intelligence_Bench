To solve the problem:

1. The first image depicts a square sheet with a dotted line in a diamond shape inside.
2. The second image shows the same square folded so that the corners meet at the center, forming a smaller square at the middle.
3. Following another similar fold, this would result in another, even smaller square at the center of the third image.

When comparing to the given choices, consider that the process described results in alternating layers:

- The folding pattern forms four triangular flaps that fold inwards.
- The center square becomes visible, surrounded by four triangular sections.

Upon inspection, the correct choice resembles the structure formed by these inward-folding triangular flaps.

The correct image is Choice 5.
