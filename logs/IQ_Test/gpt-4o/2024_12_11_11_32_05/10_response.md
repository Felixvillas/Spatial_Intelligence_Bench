To determine the final shape, we fold each part of the image step by step:

1. **First Shape (Triangle with Vertical Line):**
   - Fold along the vertical dotted line down the center of the triangle. It divides the triangle into two identical right triangles.

2. **Second Shape (Triangle with Horizontal Line):**
   - Fold along the horizontal dotted line. This divides the shape into two congruent parts, aligning one smaller triangle perfectly on top of the other.

3. **Third Shape (Rectangle with Two Lines):**
   - First, fold along the diagonal dotted line on the rectangle, forming a smaller rectangle.
   - Then, fold along the horizontal dotted line. It should align a small triangle onto a section of the larger triangle.

When these folds are performed in sequence, the resulting shape should resemble Choice 5.
