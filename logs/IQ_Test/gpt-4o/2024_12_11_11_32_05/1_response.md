To determine which piece is missing, let's analyze the blocks:

1. **Block Disassembly:**
   - The first block is a 3x3 cube comprised of smaller colored blocks.
   - The visible layers are two yellow layers and one cyan-pink layer on top.

2. **Identify Missing Piece Based on Visible Layers:**
   - The cyan layer is mostly on the front face, and the pink section is on the top side.
   - By looking at the layout, the absent piece appears to complete the shape by fitting the pink area.

3. **Choices Comparison:**
   - Review the choices to see which one fits the missing gap with respect to the pink area.
   - Choice 5 aligns with the visible incomplete pink formation.

Thus, the missing piece is the one that completes the corner alignment with the pink piece, making the cube contiguous.
