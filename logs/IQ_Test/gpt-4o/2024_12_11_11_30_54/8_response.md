To determine which 3-D shape corresponds to the 2-D representations:

1. **Examine the 2-D Representations**:
   - Each representation appears to show a hexagonal or similar polygonal top, vertical sides, and a complex base shape.

2. **Inspect the 3-D Choices**:
   - All choices have a similar top structure, but differs in the base and orientation of the sides.
  
3. **Match the Shapes**:
   - Compare the orientation and alignment of the top, sides, and base in the 3-D images to find a match with the 2-D representations.

Choice 1 and 5 show a configuration where the side and base match the complex step-like 2-D views.

Thus, the answer is Choice 1.
