To solve the sequence puzzle, let's analyze the changes:

1. We notice that each block formation gains a new cube with each step.
2. Observe the position and pattern of added cubes.
3. The sequence shows cubes added from bottom to top. 

Given these observations, let's evaluate the choices:

- The first, second, and third figures each add one cube progressively from bottom to top.
- In the third figure, the newly added cube starts forming a new layer on top.

Given the pattern and progression, the next figure in the sequence is choice 5, which continues to add a cube on top of the previous layer.
