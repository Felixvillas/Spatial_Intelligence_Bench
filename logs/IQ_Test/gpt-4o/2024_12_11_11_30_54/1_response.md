To determine the missing piece, we analyze the main block composed of yellow and blue cubes:

1. **Count the Cubes**: The structure is 3x3x3, totaling 27 cubes.
2. **Visible Pieces**: Notice the distinct pieces:
   - **Left Piece**: Yellow, "L-shaped"
   - **Middle Piece**: Blue, rectangular with 2x2x1
   - **Absent Purple Cubes**: These are missing but visualized within the structure.
3. **Purple Piece**: The missing portion must form a shape that integrates into the main block's volume.

The purple piece should fit in the remaining space.

After comparing the choices visually:

- Choices 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are visual variations of cubic configurations.
- By visualizing the integration of each choice into the yellow-blue structure, Choice 1 matches the remaining space.

Therefore, the missing piece is:
