To determine the resulting shape, let's unfold the process step by step.

1. The first two shapes fold together to form a larger triangular prism shape.
2. The third image shows a square folding over to create a right triangle on the outside edge.
3. This will align with the larger triangular prism.

The resulting figure should match the final 3D shape when folded. Based on the analysis, the correct choice is Choice 3.
