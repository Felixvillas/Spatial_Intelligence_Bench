To identify the pattern, let's observe the sequence:

1. Red face is solved, yellow face starts completing from the bottom.
2. Yellow extends upward, blue face starts completing from the bottom.
3. Yellow forms a complete face along with some blue at the top and green appears at the bottom on the blue face.

Following this logic, the next image should further complete the yellow and blue sides while incorporating more green.

Now, let's analyze the choices:

- Choice 1: Yellow extends further up, blue is almost complete, with a small portion of green.
- Choice 2-5: None of these progress based on the observation from choice 1.

The logical completion from the previous sequence and choice option supports choosing Choice 1.
