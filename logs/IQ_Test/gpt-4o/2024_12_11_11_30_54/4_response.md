To solve this, we need to observe the sequence of the shapes and see how they change from one to the next.

1. In the given sequence, the shape seems to be rotating, or the colored faces are shifting around the object.
2. The first image shows a red face on the left, a yellow bottom face, and a red slanted face.
3. The second image seems to have rotated so that the yellow face is on top, and the red face is on the front, as if pivoted to the left.
4. The third image shows only the red front face and the implication is that the previous visible left red face has moved to the front.

To predict the next shape:
- The next step in the sequence should be consistent with the shifting pattern seen previously.
- Given the existing rotation, we can assume the shape will rotate to increase visibility of the yellow portion again after the red front was seen.

From the possible choices:
- Choice 1 shows a red and yellow section similar to the desired result after rotation.
- Others either have incorrect positioning or additional yellow portions.

Choice 1 seems to be the shape that fits next in the sequence.
