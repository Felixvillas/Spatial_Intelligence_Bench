To determine which image would result from folding the sheet along the dotted lines, let's analyze the process step by step:

1. The first shape is a square with a smaller diamond inside, connected by dotted lines suggesting folding.
2. Once folded along these lines, the four corners will converge towards the center of the square.
3. The corners will overlap at the center, forming a layered square with alternating colors and a pattern.

Now, looking at the result images:

- It involves checking which pattern forms after folding.
- The result will have a smaller visible square or diamond in the center, with peripheral layers.
  
After matching this understanding with the options provided, choice 5 fits this description.
