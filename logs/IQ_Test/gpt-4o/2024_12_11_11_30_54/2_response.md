To determine the resulting shape from folding the given parallelogram along the dotted line:

1. The original shape is a parallelogram.
2. The dotted line divides it into two equal parts, each being a right triangle.
3. When folded along the dotted line, the two triangles will overlap perfectly.
4. This results in a shape that is also a parallelogram, but with half the original area.

Analyzing the choices:

- Choice 1: It¡¯s the same parallelogram, but not reduced in size.
- Choice 2: A square, not a possible resulting shape.
- Choice 3: Two triangles side by side, not the correct folded result.
- Choice 4: Two triangles overlapping properly, forming a smaller parallelogram.
- Choice 5: A parallelogram, similar to 4 but likely larger.

Thus, the correct choice is the one where the triangles overlap to create a smaller, similar parallelogram.
