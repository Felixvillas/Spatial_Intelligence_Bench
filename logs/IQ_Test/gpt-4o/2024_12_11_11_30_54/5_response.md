To determine the next image in the sequence, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence of shapes:

1. The first shape is a block configuration with four layers stacked horizontally.
2. The second shape rotates to a more compact shape with four layers stacked vertically.
3. The third shape rotates again but keeps the same vertical stacking with four layers.

Observing the sequence, each shape is a rotated version of the previous shape while maintaining the same number of blocks and general structure.

Choice 5 continues the rotation pattern from the third shape.
