To build the cube using the given pieces, let's analyze the connections and ensure all faces of the cube are covered without any duplicates or missing colors.

The four pieces have the following pairs of connected colors:

1. Yellow - Grey
2. Blue - Grey
3. Blue - Yellow
4. Green - Blue

For a complete cube using these colors, all sides must correctly connect with one neighboring similar colored piece, with all six face colors represented without repetition on any one face.

Pieces and positions:

- Match Yellow with Yellow:
  - Pieces 1 and 3 connect.
- Match Grey with Grey:
  - Pieces 1 and 2 connect.
- Match Blue continuation:
  - Combine piece 4 (Green - Blue).
  - Remaining Blue from adjacent connections.

From here, we test configurations visually against the provided choices. Doing this makes it apparent that:

- **Choice 2** fully and correctly represents these color position connections.

Hence, the cube correctly formed using these pieces is shown in **Choice 2**.
