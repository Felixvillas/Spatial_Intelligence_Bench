To solve the sequence puzzle, let's analyze the pattern step-by-step:

1. **Look at the sequence of original images:**
   - The first image has a base structure and a number of blocks stacked on top.
   - The second image shifts one block from the base to the top/back area, reducing the front size.
   - The third image shifts more blocks to create a reverse 'L' shape.

2. **Identify the pattern:**
   - The pattern involves removing blocks from the base bottom and adding them to the opposite top/back area.
   - This transformation seems to rotate the L-shape backwards around a central axis.

3. **Estimate the next step:**
   - Based on the existing pattern, the expected next image will continue rotating more blocks to the back, maintaining a similar transformation.

4. **Validate with choices:**
   - Choice 4 matches this transformation by following similar rotations and additions of blocks to the opposite side.

Thus, the next image in the sequence is Choice 4.
