To determine which shape will result from folding the image along the dotted line:

1. Observe the original shape, which is a parallelogram.
2. The dotted line is a vertical line that cuts the parallelogram into two equal halves.
3. When you fold the parallelogram along the dotted line, the two halves will align to form a smaller parallelogram with the same orientation.

So, the resulting shape will be a parallelogram (half of the original).

Therefore, choice 5 represents this smaller parallelogram.
