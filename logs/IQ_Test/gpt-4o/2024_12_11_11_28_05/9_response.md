To solve this problem, let's analyze the sequence of folding:

1. The original sheet is a square with a smaller diamond inside it illustrated by the dotted lines.
2. When folded along the dotted lines, each corner of the square folds inward towards the center of the diamond shape.
3. This results in a pattern where additional layers (triangles) are formed along the inside.

Now, let's compare this result to the choices provided:

- **Choice 1**: Shows a symmetrical pattern with both yellow and blue areas.
- **Choice 2**: Similar to Choice 1 but with more emphasis on the yellow color.
- **Choice 3**: Shows yellow on the outer parts with a blue center.
- **Choice 4**: Has a comparable pattern to Choice 3.
- **Choice 5**: Shows a prominent blue center with yellow on the outer parts.

Based on the folding process, the final image will have an alternating pattern due to the symmetry in folding. The folds will result in smaller connected triangles converging centrally, alternating yellow and blue depending on the folded sides.

The correct choice is the one that shows this specific arrangement, similar to the pattern visible when each triangle converges at the center forming a symmetrical shape with a blue center and yellow outlining in an inner square.

The configuration matches **Choice 4**.
