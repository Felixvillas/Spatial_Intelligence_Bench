To determine the missing piece, follow these steps:

1. **Total Pieces Identification**:
   - The original block is made of yellow, cyan, and magenta cubes.
   - Yellow and cyan pieces are already present in the disassembled form.

2. **Cyan and Yellow Blocks Analysis**:
   - Yellow piece: L-shaped with 9 cubes.
   - Cyan piece: Contains 4 cubes (2x2 shape).

3. **Missing Cubes Calculation**:
   - The original block is 3x3x3, totaling 27 cubes.
   - Yellow has 9 cubes and cyan has 4, totaling 13 cubes.
   - Thus, 27 - 13 = 14 cubes must be the magenta block.

4. **Magenta Block Analysis**:
   - We need a magenta block with 14 cubes.
  
5. **Check Choices**:
   - Choice 1: Has 14 cubes fitting the requirement.
