The first image shows one face of the shape colored red and yellow, with its orientation so that the red face is facing left and the yellow face is facing downward.\\n2. The second image shows the shape rotated slightly. The right-red face remains red, but the yellow face is now below it.\\n3. The third image has the red face on the right with the yellow face oriented downward toward the right.\\n\\nThe pattern indicates that the shape is being rotated such that the red face stays prominent but shifts along visible faces while the yellow face moves around it. \\n\\nTherefore, the next image in the sequence should still keep the red face prominent with the yellow face adjacent but rotated from the last orientation.\\n\\nBy examining the choices:\\n\\n- **Choice 1**: Has red on one side and yellow below, matching the pattern.\\n- **Choice 2** and **Choice 5**: Reverses the colors.\\n- **Choice 3**: Adds more triangular sections.\\n- **Choice 4**: Doesn't have the yellow, contradicting the sequence.\\n\\nChoice 1 matches the expected continuation.
