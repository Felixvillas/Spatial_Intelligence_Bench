To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **First Part:** Fold the triangle along the vertical dotted line. This will result in two halves overlapping, forming a single triangle shape.

2. **Second Part:** Fold the rhombus along both of its dotted lines. This will make the small triangle overlap with a part of the main structure, keeping the original triangular base shape.

After completing these folds, compare with the given choices:

- Choices 1 and 4 have shapes that resemble the folded version accurately.

However, considering the precise orientation and overlap, the correct choice is Choice 4.
