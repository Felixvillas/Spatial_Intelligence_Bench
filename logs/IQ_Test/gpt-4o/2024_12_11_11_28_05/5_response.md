To solve this problem, let's analyze the pattern in the sequence:

1. The first image shows a 3D arrangement of cubes forming two rows of three.
2. The second image shows a similar 3D arrangement but with an extra cube added in the center, making it two rows of four.
3. The third image has reverted to the original form of two rows of three cubes.

The pattern seems to be alternating between the two configurations: 
- Two rows of three cubes.
- Two rows of four cubes (with an additional cube added in the center).

Following this pattern, the next in the sequence should be the configuration with two rows of four cubes.

Let¡¯s check the choices:
- Choice 1: Matches the pattern of two rows of three cubes.
- Choice 2: Matches the target pattern of two rows of four cubes.
- Choice 3: Incorrect shape pattern.
- Choice 4: Incorrect shape pattern.
- Choice 5: Incorrect shape pattern.

Therefore, the next image in the sequence is Choice 2.
