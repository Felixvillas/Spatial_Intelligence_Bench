To solve the sequence, I will analyze the changes in each step:

1. **Initial Observation**: 
   - The first cube has the top red and the front yellow.
   - The second cube also has the top red, but a different yellow face is visible.
   - The third cube shows a blue face on top and a green square appearing on the front.

2. **Pattern Analysis**: 
   - From the first to the second image, the cube rotates clockwise on a vertical axis.
   - From the second to the third image, the cube tilts so that the blue face comes on top and the green square on the front becomes visible.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Following the pattern, the cube in the next sequence would continue to rotate and reveal more of the green face while maintaining the motion seen from steps 1 to 3.

4. **Matching the Pattern to Choices**:
   - The next step should show the cube rotated further, with more green on the front.
   - The choice that aligns with further revealing of green and orients the blue face differently is required.

By analyzing the visible colors and rotation patterns, **Choice 1** matches the expected rotation, where the green face placement lines up with the previous movements observed between the given sequence.
