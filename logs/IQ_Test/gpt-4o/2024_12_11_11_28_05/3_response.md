To solve this, let's identify and match the pieces with the cube faces:

1. There are four pieces, each a 2x1x1 cuboid, with colors on three visible sides.
   - Piece 1: Yellow and gray
   - Piece 2: Gray and blue
   - Piece 3: Blue and yellow
   - Piece 4: Green and blue

2. The goal is to combine these pieces to form a 2x2x2 cube.

3. Each face of the finished cube will have four visible smaller squares with different color combinations.

4. Observing the choices:

   - Choice 1 shows distinct colors forming each side with combinations fitting the pieces provided.

Since in Choice 1, each visible face on the cube can be formed using the pieces provided with matching colors, the logical assembly of these pieces results in that configuration. 

So, the correct answer is:
