To determine which 3-D shape corresponds to the given 2-D representations, we need to analyze the features of those shapes:

1. **2-D Shape Analysis**:
   - Each of the 2-D representations seems to show the same complex shape, viewed from different angles. The shape looks like it has a large flat base tapering into a narrower top with angles and edges that suggest a multi-faceted (possibly hexagonal-type) prism.

2. **Compare with 3-D Choices**:
   - **Choice 1**: The shape has a wider base and tapers inwards but lacks the complete symmetry and shape outlined in the 2-D views.
   - **Choice 2**: This one aligns with the 2-D profiles, reflecting the necessary tapering and symmetry.
   - **Choice 3**: While similar, it does not fully match all views.
   - **Choice 4**: This shape does not reflect the 3-view symmetry depicted in the 2-D images.
   - **Choice 5**: The base and top do not match the 2-D representations enough.

Upon analysis, **Choice 2** best fits the 2-D views with its shape and symmetry.
