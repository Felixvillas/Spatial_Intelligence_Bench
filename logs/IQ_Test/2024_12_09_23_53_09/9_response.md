To determine which image results from folding the sheet along the dotted lines, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Folded Parts**: The first image shows a single square with dotted lines, suggesting it is to be folded inwards along those lines.

2. **Fold the Corners**: Each corner of the square will fold towards the center, forming a smaller square in the middle and triangular regions surrounding it.

3. **Color Coordination**: The original image has a pale yellow background, and the second image shows light blue color in the folded areas.

4. **Resulting Pattern**: When folded, the center of the image will contain the new square formed by the folds, which matches the structure shown in the third image.

5. **Compare with Choices**: 
   - The choice that has a similar central design with outer areas matching the colors should be selected.

Analyzing the options gives us Choice 3 as it matches the description above, with the central square and the triangular patterns in the correct colors.
