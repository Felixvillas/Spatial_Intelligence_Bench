To solve this, let's analyze the disassembled shapes:

1. The original cube is a 3x3x3 structure.
2. The visible pieces disassembled are:
   - A yellow L-shaped piece.
   - A cyan rectangular piece.
3. To complete the puzzle, the missing piece must fit the remaining 3x3x3 structure.

Examining the options, the missing piece must fill the remaining space without overlapping the placed pieces:

- Total blocks in 3x3x3 = 27
- Yellow blocks (L-shaped) = 9
- Cyan blocks = 3
- Remaining blocks for the missing piece = 27 - 9 - 3 = 15

Upon matching these requirements, Choice 1 fits the empty space perfectly as it consists of the remaining blocks needed (15 blocks).
