To determine which image results from building a cube with the given four pieces, we can analyze how the pieces can be arranged:

1. Each piece is identical except for the colors.
2. To form a cube, each adjacent face of the joined pieces must share the same color.

Here¡¯s a quick breakdown of each piece:
- Yellow/Grey, Yellow/Blue
- Grey/Blue, Yellow/Blue
- Grey/Blue, Blue/Green
- Yellow/Green, Blue/Green

### Step-by-step analysis:
- Each cube has two colors per visible face.
- Align the blue side with adjacent blue sides, the yellow with yellow, and continue logically for all faces.
- We aim to use all colors (yellow, grey, blue, green) once on the outsides that together complete a cube.

### Checking Each Choice:
By inspecting the presented cube images based on the above logic:
- **Choice 1:**
  - Arrangement does not use all colors provided in each rectangle.
- **Choice 2:**
  - Correct alignment concerning arrangement, using the four colors appropriately.
- **Choice 3:**
  - Incorrect as faces do not logically align.
- **Choice 4:**
  - Incorrect arrangement due to repetition of yellow.
- **Choice 5:**
  - Incorrect as grey is not used as usually presented.

Thus, the **second choice** accurately depicts correct color arrangement and usage as intended by the provided pieces.
